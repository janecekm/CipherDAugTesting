and the first time i figured out that way was in this little single-person submersible called deep rover.
that chin barbel is flashing.

so, this book that i have in my hand is a directory of everybody who had an email address in 1982.
but, of course, you couldn't do it, because we don't know the names of all the people with internet or email addresses, and even if we did know their names, i'm pretty sure that they would not want their name, address and telephone number published to everyone.

the president himself is our most popular twitter user, although his tweets have dropped off as of late, while senator mccain's have picked up.

i was also an early writer, and when i began to write, at about the age of seven, stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read, i wrote exactly the kinds of stories i was reading: all my characters were white and blue-eyed, they played in the snow, they ate apples, how lovely it was that the sun had come out.

now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon by 2020, which is our desire.
we went to other countries. as i said we went to denmark.
and the most fascinating thing we've learned is that, when you have small problems on the individual level, like the price of gasoline to drive every morning.
and that's the difference between problems that are additive, like co2, which we go slowly up and then we tip, and problems that are depletive, in which we lose what we have, which oscillate, and they oscillate until we lose everything we've got.
they basically looked at it and said, "car 1.0 we'll solve everything within the car itself."
the two numbers are zero -- as in zero footprint or zero oil -- and scale it infinity.
we need to have presidential leadership just like we had in israel that said we will end oil.

what this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the internet wrong.
thank you.
there's been kind of a series of epiphanies.
now, i know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment -- i'm kidding -- but these are the recapitulation slides, and then i'm going to go into new material about what you can do.
there is a carbon calculator. participant productions convened, with my active involvement, the leading software writers in the world on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator.
and in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did.
so the blowout in the gulf is just a little piece of a much larger problem that we have with the energy that we use to run civilization.
if you go to the places where it's just arriving, like the eastern part of the gulf, in alabama, there's still people using the beach while there are people cleaning up the beach.
and i learned -- in fact, i confirmed -- the hypothesis that oil and water don't mix until you add a dispersant, and then they start mixing.

i started building this project when i was about 12 or 13 years old.
we live in in a remarkable time, the age of genomics.
you know, you guys are so great, you don't even know what a connectome is, and you're willing to play along with me.
but this is just a single neuron.
now, at this point, you've learned the basics of neurons and synapses.
why did i choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite?
and if you put those two facts together, it means that your experiences can change your connectome.
according to a theory that dates back to the 19th century, such memories are stored as chains of synaptic connections inside your brain.
one of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death by that practice known as cryonics.
of these six, the first one that we're going to talk about is in the black envelope you're holding.
and as we thought about it more, we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience, just as if you saw it on tv. so, for ted we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with roman and his team at the directors bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future.
there're a few different versions of it.
now, zach, we're going to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future.
ks: so you see there, it didn't bounce back. now, this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing.

let's see how.
i'm going to tell you how to get the united states completely off oil and coal, five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of congress led by business for profit.
currently the leader is germany.
we can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be, so they don't need to go somewhere else.
so the unbought efficiency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper.
but now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards, and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves 10 units of fuel cost, pollution and what hunter lovins calls "global weirding" back at the power plant.
that is exactly why we've designed the grid to back up failed plants with working plants.
and i heretically suggested it could go down several-fold.
amory lovins: a 40-year plan for energy
today, each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment.
tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual, and what's exciting is that with this openness, there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government.

just simple "bolt a to b" and they will be able to put them together.
and they were able to do it. that was their design, using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts, a couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck.
let's see it one more time.
i know because i've been shot down so many times i get altitude sickness just from standing up for myself.

but we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top.
well, most of you anyway.
and so what this means is that we have to accept the risks if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science.
as i should have shown this earlier, it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun; it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria.
if they continued their vigil, what might these hypothetical aliens witness will some spasm foreclose earth's future?

and i'm here today to give you a little tour, starting from the very first puzzle i designed, through what i'm doing now.
now, i should pause and say, what do i mean by puzzle?
here we have "day and night."

we should take our foot off the pedal right now, and generally we do. these things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down.
and they created this thing called the "drug facts box."
the after takes what was four pages -- that previous slide was actually the first of four pages of data that's just the general blood work.
what you're actually measuring is spelled out in clean language.
so i want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask, because i don't actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports.
it's very powerful for, i think, changing our relationship to the natural world and to the other species on whom we depend.
i had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its -- into spreading its genes, giving it a little bit more habitat.
but the weird thing is, we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later; none of us really believes this.

it's created from the bottom up.
it looks like the web did back in 1997, right?
but this next decade -- and that's a real thing.
and this is simply an appointment dynamic.
they should consciously recognize that they've built an appointment dynamic and leverage the games.
and at princeton, they've actually experimented with this, where they have quizzes where you gain experience points, and you level up from b to an a.
these progression dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world.
we can influence behavior.
you can see that japan is busy at night, right there.
this is what one second looks like.
now does anybody know who this is?
there are a variety of demographics. i won't bore you with these.
you know, the googlettes -- that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not, but we hope it will, and if we do enough of them, some of them will really work and turn out, such as news.
we also like to innovate in our physical space, and we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off, and they're noisy, so people shut them off.
and these ads are generated automatically -- like in this case, on the washington post -- from the content on the site.
and so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed, and he said, "you know, i'm sleeping a lot."
i thought, at the time, i did a pretty good job.
he imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in london and disembark from a ship in new york.
it's often about understanding culture and context before we even know where to start to have ideas.
so if human need is the place to start, and prototyping, a vehicle for progress, then there are also some questions to ask about the destination.
and that change is forcing us to question quite fundamental aspects of our society -- how we keep ourselves healthy, how we govern ourselves, how we educate ourselves, how we keep ourselves secure.
and just like brunel, by focusing on systems, we can have a bigger impact.
"i understand," i said, "that the japanese do not put sugar in their green tea, but i'd like to put some sugar in my green tea."
but do all individuals benefit from taking such an approach to choice?
to insist that they choose independently might actually compromise both their performance and their relationships.
combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better, and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters and so every choice matters.
but it is not only other people in other places that are feeling the pressure of ever-increasing choice.
we found that it did.
no single narrative serves the needs of everyone everywhere.
and the other one was called "adorable."
on the top line, this is the bp oil spill: billions of barrels of oil gushing in the gulf of mexico.
and, playing, i realized that the maneuverability of this was really amazing, and i could avoid an obstacle at the very last second, more maneuverable than a normal boat.
but new properties of a sailing boat.
less than one week after, this is a team in eindhoven, it's a school of engineering.
you know, the computer and television both recently turned 60, and today i'd like to talk about their relationship.
let me give you an example of this. the year is 1976, and warner buys atari because video games are on the rise.
so take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers, and the computer begins to express itself.
they adapt whirlwind to a massive air defense system, deploy it all across the frozen north, and spend nearly three times as much on this computer as was spent on the manhattan project building the a-bomb in the first place.
so, the next time they tell you they're on to something, clearly they're not.
you all set? ok, let's get right to the first story about dusty man.
you have extreme concern with everybody else's business and much involvement in everybody else's life.
they saw these tools that were controlled by the establishment as ones that could actually be liberated and put to use by these communities that they were trying to build.
that's like a dick cheney speech.
eventually, the race to the future took on added momentum with the breakup of the telephone company.
mm: because it gave the audience a role, something to do.
they're producing things for between 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute.
there's been more raw dna of communications and media thrown out there. content is moving from shows to particles that are batted back and forth, and part of social communications, and i think this is going to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity.
i then kind of thought about the other cities in europe where i spend a lot of time looking for design, like basel, where vitra is located, or in northern italy -- all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles, and where pedestrian areas -- and i came to the conclusion that perhaps there was something about these important design centers that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic, and i'm sure the skeptic eye would say, no, the correlation there is that there are universities and schools where people can't afford cars, but it did seem that in many of these areas pedestrian traffic was protected.
construction site in new york: red having this kind of emotional power that's almost an equivalent with the way in which -- cuteness of puppies and such.
and i realized that, you know, italy is a place where they can accept these different ideologies and deal with diversity and not have the problem, or they can choose to ignore them, but these -- you don't have warring factions, and i think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity which has made italy so innovative and so tolerant.
post-second world war, the influence of the automobile has really been devastating in a lot of our cities.
now i'm talking about the '30s.
you couldn't transfer those to the model itself.
any of you who rode the automobiles -- was it yesterday? -- at the track, you know the romance revolving around those high performance cars.
design nowadays, if you mean it, you don't start with styling sketches.
and he showed her the lever.
just your own.
and there is a variety of other things: the shape of the cushions, the gel we put.
it doesn't really matter. it's the same mosquito, and it's the same disease. you're at risk.
so the one thing you'll find is that where the mosquito goes, dengue will follow.
it has to be safe.
and if you can put more, i'll call them sterile, that the offspring will actually die at different stages, but i'll call them sterile for now.
and for brazil, where we've been doing some trials, the brazilian government themselves have now built their own mosquito factory, far bigger than ours, and we'll use that for scaling up in brazil.
i started asking my questions, "well, why me?"
well, when i have done this on myself, i always come to the conclusion that i spend about 75 percent of my time relatively in a small number of places.
they really don't do that. it's missing.
for every community in the united states, you could have your own personalized map of that.
so with that, i'll leave you that in my particular view of view of health: geography always matters.
grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions.
nobody wants to drink blue algae-contaminated water, or swim in a blue algae-infested lake.
and more importantly still, phosphorus is a key component of dna, something everyone is familiar with, and which is shown in this image.
nobody wants to throw their money out the window, but unfortunately that's what is happening here.
by 2050 there will be 9 billion of us, and according to the u.n. food and agriculture organization, we will need to produce twice as much food in 2050 than we do today.
it will proliferate between the root's cells, eventually penetrating a cell and starting to form a typical arbuscular structure, which will considerably increase the exchange interface between the plant and the mushroom.
in other words, as i already said, i have invented nothing.
the hanging chain models of antonio gaudi, the catalan architect.
the elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting, they're all losing their modular quality, and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions.
because we're using escalators to move people, all of these trusses are picking up diagonal loads.
to go back to architecture, what's organic about architecture as a field, unlike product design, is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm.
and i also bought a laser cutter and started to fabricate within my own shop, kind of, large-scale building elements and models, where we could go directly to the tooling.
in fact, what you're seeing here are soybean fields.
the difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food, or maybe golf courses in scottsdale, you take your pick.
there's a lot of toxic waste, a lot of things that were dumped there that are now becoming airborne.
we've doubled the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus around the world simply by using fertilizers, causing huge problems of water quality from rivers, lakes, and even oceans, and it's also the single biggest driver of biodiversity loss.
now, this would require nutrients and water.
more than 40% of earth's land has been cleared for agriculture.
as the world grows by several billion more people, we'll need to double, maybe even triple, global food production.
and this is a business incubator.
that's a huge number, and what does that mean?
the name is a misnomer.
secondly, from the [austrian] anarchist philosopher paul feyerabend, facts are relative, and what is a massive right of self-reliance to a nigerian businessperson is considered unauthorized and horrible to other people, and we have to recognize that there are differences in how people define things and what their facts are.
there are two general types.
there's no other functions.
now you think, "close hand," and a little section of your chest contracts.
he has not learned how to do this with the chest.
all right.
ak: a little faster. and much more easy, much more natural.
and i have the wrist flexion and extension.
so amanda, you can see, has really good control.
so we're really challenged on what we're doing there.
i'd like to share with you the story of one of my patients called celine.
even more problematic reasons include lower risk of litigation, less rigorous ethical reviews, and populations that are willing to participate in almost any study that hints at a cure.
i think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin in the first place without a clear plan for what would happen to the participants once the trial has ended.
it's the same problems in the galapagos, except, obviously, it's worse here, in some ways, than other places.
but scientifically, they're amazing because they're sentinels.
that brings all the nutrients: when this is cold in the galapagos, it's rich, and there's plenty of food for everyone.
and so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real plight of penguins.
i'm just going to talk about two things.
turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak, we let him in and he comes in here.
and then there's another fellow that will leisurely come by.
well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved: our basic political geography.
and they share a lengthy land border.
again, like mongolia, china isn't conquering russia. it's just leasing it.
for poorer countries, china reduces tariffs so that laos and cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply and become dependent on exporting to china as well.
what i want to present to you is what i call state building, day by day.
these two arrows are an arc, an arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure that link the west bank and gaza.
a great deal of them.
so what is next? what is the future of the european union?
53 countries, and by far the most number of suspiciously straight lines on the map.
this is a dream of the ages.
is it miserable? it doesn't seem to be.
okay.
and the hormone igf-1 promotes growth.
so how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging?
well we think that insulin and igf-1 hormones are hormones that are particularly active under favorable conditions -- in the good times -- when food is plentiful and there's not a lot of stress in the environment.
we don't know the details of how this works, but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people.
so if you stop taking the drug, the protein would go back to normal.
they're more resistant to these kinds of stresses.
imagine if the private sector advertised in the same way -- if nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes and put an ad in the paper like that.
and you might think this is a small thing, but i think it's important because it sets a tone and it reinforces the dangerous idea that politics is a spectator sport.
we use out-of-date systems that are unfair and create random results.
we know much less about their treatment and the understanding of their basic mechanisms than we do about diseases of the body.
so if we inhibit a particular type of neuron, and we find that a behavior is blocked, we can conclude that those neurons are necessary for that behavior.
so we built a device, which we call a puff-o-mat, in which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench and blow them away.
well, if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies, they don't learn. their learning score is zero.
don't you?
on the left here you see the bites by the dutch malarial mosquito on this person.
and so we set up another crazy experiment, because we collected the smell of these larvae, put it on pieces of cloth, and then did something very remarkable.
there we go. okay.
as the demand for donor organs continues to rise, in large part due to the aging population, the supply has remained relatively constant.
now just about that time, the practice of surgery evolved from big to small, from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures, tiny incisions.
if this research is successful, it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos.
while still in a research phase, stem cells may one day herald a quantum leap in the field of cardiology.
and we want to play a little piece for you by one of the most important composers of america.
what are they doing right?
in other words, men, you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department.
but here's a scary one: divorce is contagious.
jenna mccarthy: what you don't know about marriage
to make progress, we need to break the code.
you don't need to know where these receivers are, and it doesn't matter if these receivers move -- just think of the stereo in your car.
and you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect.
these decisions are clearly a reflection of the actor's policy.
this means that the critic must have spoken in that animal, and that the critic must be contained among the dopamine-producing neurons on the left, but not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right.
come to think of it, knowing when you're wrong without a teacher, or your mother, telling you, is a very hard problem.
it's unaffordable globally.
eric dishman: i'm good. i'm just taking my clothes off in front of a few hundred people. it's wonderful.
humans invented the idea of hospitals and clinics in the 1780s. it is time to update our thinking.
three different specialists had prescribed three different versions of the same drug to me.
and the magic here is, experiment on my avatar in software, not my body in suffering.
but until such time that these amazing technologies are available to all of us, and even when they are, it's up to us to care for, and even save, one another.
this the first time someone has actually climbed with it.
it has a tail. and just when you think you've figured out nature, this kind of thing happens.
it can also be used in defense.
but geckos do it better.
it oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin.
you see it there? there? watch it come down.
and i think we all found it, simultaneously, an eye-opening and a very frustrating experience.
here in galapagos, we're affected by el ninos and la nina.
one day where we had calm seas and sun, which was the reason i could get off the ship.
now, there's 40 scientists working on this project, and people are doing all kinds of really complicated and expensive analyses.
we do expect to see a sea-level rise on the order of one to two meters by the end of this century.
and she was diving here with john lauret -- i think it was 1994 -- and collected a little nugget and sent it to me.
but we get these instrumental- and near-instrumental-quality records of temperature change that go back hundreds of years, here's a synthetic diagram.
you know, we're pumping out lots of co2 into the atmosphere, from fossil fuels, from cement production.
and i think that may very well be true, so i'll close with this.
but if there is matter in the environment, such as the sun, it causes the fabric of space to warp, to curve.
and when he looked at that equation, it was none other than the equation that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force.
but deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself, the idea is there could be more dimensions, as we see there.
and just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello can vibrate in different patterns, these can also vibrate in different patterns.
now, does string theory offer an answer?
and if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns, we should be able to calculate those 20 numbers.
physicist brian greene explains superstring theory, the idea that minscule strands of energy vibrating in 11 dimensions create every particle and force in the universe.
but first, we have to ask another question, which is, "what is color for?"
and yet it's only the retinal information that we get.
one is simply the flipping of the other. okay?
notice that on the left the two tiles look nearly completely opposite: one very white and one very dark.
yes? raise your hand if you got that. yes?
and sometimes they learn not to go to the blue, but to go to where the other bees go.
in each square we calculate the average color.
because now the light is going through a yellowish filter and then a purplish filter.
whether this is a personal decision -- whether you're going to install a burglar alarm in your home -- or a national decision -- where you're going to invade some foreign country -- you're going to trade off something, either money or time, convenience, capabilities, maybe fundamental liberties.
the answer is, we respond to the feeling of security and not the reality.
you don't hear about lion attacks, there aren't a lot of lions around.
so back to economics.
it doesn't change; it's real.
because we had different models based on our different experiences.
so a nice example of this came from last year and swine flu.
compare that to the secondhand smoke debate -- probably about 20 years behind.
also, personal experiences with crime can do it, personal health scare, a health scare in the news.
remember i said feeling, model, reality; i said reality doesn't change. it actually does.
i go home, i look it up.
would look at it.
hispanic kids, two out of three ate the marshmallow; one out of three did not.
the highline is an old, elevated rail line that runs for a mile and a half right through manhattan.
and it turns out, we got those numbers wrong.
the high line used to be covered in billboards, and so we've taken a playful take where, instead of framing advertisements, it's going to frame people in views of the city.
the red is modern conflict, conflicts within states.
let us turn to afghanistan.
and you can always walk.
and how can we tell the muslim brotherhood, as we should, that they must respect minority rights, if we don't accept majority rights?
if we're going to deal with political conflict-solving of conflicts, if we're going to understand these new groups which are coming from bottom-up, supported by technology, which is available to all, we diplomats cannot be sitting back in the banquets believing that we are doing interstate relations.
what is it that makes people trust each other, not only between states, but also within states?
and i could sense that she thought i was speaking synecdochically.
they made, so far as we can tell, 900 of them.
while i was in easter island, comet mcnaught was there also, so you get a gratuitous picture of a moai with a comet.
rays of light -- in this case, microwave light -- come in, and they just squish around the cell, and they come back the other side.
i perform a series of ghoulish experiments on food -- in this case, trying to calibrate a mathematical model so that one can predict exactly what the internal cooking times are.
i'm known to tedsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs.
so, the thing that's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs is that it is both an intellectual thing, because you're trying to reconstruct the environment of millions of years ago.
there's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex.
it is the hot topic.
so why all the big deal about genetics?
so to do that, what you really need to do, you need to look at the things that the genes are producing and what's happening after the genetics, and that's what proteomics is about.
and he took me through specific examples of when he really needed it.
and so we can make these measurements precisely enough that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences.
that conversation inside of you got mixed up in some way.
david got me invited to give a talk at national cancer institute and anna barker was there.
danny hills makes a case for the next frontier of cancer research: proteomics, the study of proteins in the body. as hillis explains it, genomics shows us a list of the ingredients of the body -- while proteomics shows us what those ingredients produce. understanding what's going on in your body at the protein level may lead to a new understanding of how cancer happens.
all of you are members of tribes.
and i want to make the point that as members of society, we need to.
now when we go on to stage three: this is the one that hits closest to home for many of us.
this is from a company called zappos, located outside las vegas.
this is a scene or snippet from the truth and reconciliation process in south africa for which desmond tutu won the nobel prize.
what about martin luther king?
now here is what happened to this person who eventually became mayor of san francisco.
they wanted to change the world. so here is the question someone asked.
another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch.
or the recorded crowing of a rooster?
the ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap.
unsuspecting guests were served stewed turn-of-the-century turkish figs for breakfast.
it is organic, across our religious, spiritual and ethical traditions, and yet it transcends them.
and compassion does seek physicality.
we need those things too, but we're also bumping up against their limits.
some of his favorites were moses, jesus, buddha, st. francis of assisi, gandhi -- he adored his contemporary, gandhi.
so i want to propose a final definition of compassion -- this is einstein with paul robeson by the way -- and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology.
and then the second time i tried it, the counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all work very hard to be outgoing.
not all the time -- these things aren't absolute -- but a lot of the time.
even carl jung, the psychologist who first popularized these terms, said that there's no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert.
so...
the same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us love and trust.
and for me, that seven years was like total bliss, because i was reading, i was writing, i was thinking, i was researching.
i'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again, but i am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often.
and, as you can imagine, if you can picture this: i was born in a very small village in mexico, in, unfortunately, very poor surroundings, and my parents did not have a college education.
a tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the internet.
so, we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down.
and the last piece, which is really important -- and this is an opinion that we have, not shared by many, this is one where we seem to stand alone, on this one -- is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local, integrated, end-to-end ecosystems.
but to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be, one of the objectives of the one laptop per child is to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life.
it's got to be that someday i can look back, and this place is truly better through some small contribution that perhaps each of us could make.
i think that comes down to this issue of meaning, of significance, of purpose.
everybody's betting their life on something.
do you believe that as human beings -- i'm not talking about religion -- do you believe that as human beings, it is our responsibility to take care of this planet and make it just a little bit better for the next generation? "
third thing is, i added up all that the church had paid me over the last 25 years, and i gave it back.
if money actually made you happy, then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest.
i want you to spread the fame of my name through every land.
but moses, if you saw the movie, "the ten commandments," moses goes out, and there's this burning bush, and god talks to him.
now, what was in moses' hand?
you're an nba player. it represents your income.
and i just watched their little bodies rise and lower, rise and lower.
so, in rough numbers, there are a million laptops.
this is an education project, not a laptop project.
and i'm like, "you know, all the signs we keep seeing with the chinese character on them."
dreadful. thumbs down.
so there you are in grade school, and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper.
this internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world.
and yeah, it is also why we get things wrong.
and something else happened instead.
kathryn schulz: on being wrong
this is how you farm oil. and as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved, we started with this brute force approach. and then what did we learn? then we learned we had to go bigger. and then what'd we learn? then we have to go even bigger. and we are getting really destructive as we're going out and farming this bioenergy.
but in the meantime, for the next decade at least, the name of the game is hydrocarbons. and be that oil, be that gas, be that coal, this is what we're dealing with. and before i make this talk too long, here's what's happening in the current energy system.
as i spent time with vivian, i saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre in how she did her work.
one of the simplest facts in business is something that we often neglect, and that is that we're all human.
so as leaders, we understand that intangibles are important, but we don't have a clue how to measure them.
and he's a very wise man, and he said, "listen, bhutan's goal is not to create happiness.
bhutan's created the ultimate export, a new global currency of well-being, and there are 40 countries around the world today that are studying their own gnh.
that's about it.
they've created a habitat of happiness for dave.
i said, read what you're seeing. right?
so how can we ever do anything new? well fortunately, evolution has given us an answer, right?
so amy, would you please come up?
the one on the left is mine, okay?
what was the feedback like?
okay, how about if everyone over there shouts. one, two, three?
what people don't think about is: what if the oil had made it safely to shore?
say, "oh, little bottle.
it turns out we're a pretty clever species.
and they ask a question, and the question is: how can these people be so passionate?
it's closer than you think. it's kind of remarkable when you consider that there are no operational powered lift aircraft.
historically you see that we got around 200 years ago by canals, and as that system disappeared, were replaced by railroads.
still not a practical vehicle during all of this, but moving in the right direction, we believe.
we have four computers. we have two parachutes.
that we need an alternative to the automobile, at least for those 50-mile trips and more, so that the highways become usable in today's world.
40 billion of these things built.
and if you can bring another device close enough to the source, that will only work at exactly that frequency, you can actually get them to do what's called strongly couple, and transfer magnetic energy between them.
credit cards, robot vacuum cleaners.
so, there is nothing going on. i'm okay.
so that when you walk in or you come in from home, if you carry a purse, it works in your purse.
and in a traditional american funeral, a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics to make it look alive.
the infinity mushroom is a subset of decompiculture i'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation -- the cultivation of organisms that decompose and clean toxins in bodies.
so i went to a party.
then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely.
this time it's on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that i've never met before tells me that terence is dying, perhaps tonight.
yet i had that piece of paper.
you've succeeded in everything you've done, and having a patient die, well, that must feel like failure.
terence loved poetry, and the greek poet constantine cavafy is one of my favorite poets.
amanda bennett and her husband were passionate and full of life all throughout their lives together -- and up until the final days, too. bennett gives a sweet yet powerful talk on why, for the loved ones of the dying, having hope for a happy ending shouldn't warrant a diagnosis of "denial." she calls for a more heroic narrative for death -- to match the ones we have in life.
we collect four gigabits per second of data, if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down.
we do this all through software, algorithms and math -- a highly automated pipeline creating these cities.
the first question there is why china has grown so much faster than india.
if you believe that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe, then you will put less emphasis on strong government.
so clearly, infrastructure doesn't explain why china did better before the late 1990s, as compared with india.
the problem with that view is like asking all the winners of lotteries, "have you won the lottery?"
in china, the definition of literacy is the ability to read and write 1,500 chinese characters.
if you look at other east asian countries, women there play a hugely important role in terms of economic take-off -- in terms of creating the manufacturing miracle associated with east asia.
a little-known fact about india in the 1990s is that the country not only has undertaken economic reforms, the country has also undertaken political reforms by introducing village self-rule, privatization of media and introducing freedom of information acts.
economist yasheng huang compares china to india, and asks how china's authoritarian rule contributed to its astonishing economic growth -- leading to a big question: is democracy actually holding india back? huang's answer may surprise you.
and i think i've found a few.
it's called a "neonurture device."
and when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab, we have this image -- you know, they're pouring over the microscope, and they see something in the tissue sample.
now the challenge for all of us is: how do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this kind of long half-life, right?
it was right at 20 mhz, so you could pick it up really easily, because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax, basically.
and he said, "oh, that's great.
but what's even more striking is what's happening at the very tippy top of the income distribution.
think of all the years reformers of various stripes have tried to get rid of corruption in russia, for instance, or how hard it is to re-regulate the banks even after the most profound financial crisis since the great depression, or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies, including those whose motto might be "don't do evil," to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that paid by the middle class.
and that's because, in contrast with crony capitalism, so much of what globalization and the technology revolution have done is highly positive.
that's why they are spending unprecedented time and resources educating their own children.
we also, not coincidentally, went through an era of tremendous social and political inventions.
and what's really happened over the period of time that i've been working in intensive care is that the people whose lives we started saving back in the '70s,' 80s, and '90s, are now coming to die in the 21st century of diseases that we no longer have the answers to in quite the way we did then.
and i thought, surely, we do better than that.
i'm sorry to say that.

over the past two decades, since the end of the cold war, there has been an overall decline in the number of civil wars.
the defeat of the tamil tigers in sri lanka is perhaps the most recent example of this, but we have seen similar so-called military solutions in the balkans, in the south caucasus and across most of africa.
the hopes that were vested in the oslo accords did not lead to an end of the israeli / palestinian conflict.
second, diplomacy.
and one of those i'd like to share with you today.
a breath that's fossilized now as iron.
jurassic park still shimmers in part of madagascar, and the center of brazil, where plants called "cycads" remain rock hard.
new forms became bats. civets.
we call it "atmosphere." this is the icon of our journey.
parents would shuffle kids away from us.
so in 2005, the campaign got more momentum, was more successful in australia and then new zealand, and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal point.
so that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets.
and he goes, "last year, my mom passed away from breast cancer in sri lanka, because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her," and he said, "this mustache is my tribute to my mom."
so, what i know about my movember journey is that, with a really creative idea, with passion, with persistence, and a lot of patience, four mates, four mustaches, can inspire a room full of people, and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city, and that city is melbourne, my home.
so when he was only 10 and he became the paje, he began to lead his people.
we know we are running out of what we need.
but for the past eight years, i've done something completely different.
murali krishna comes from one of those villages.
these are pieces that you won't find anywhere else in the world, in part because they document parts of history chinese choose to forget.
it just happens.
'the world 'is objective, logical, universal, factual, scientific.
perhaps he was a jain monk, like bahubali over here, the gomateshwara bahubali whose image is not far from mysore.
because, you see, the greeks believed you live only once, and when you die, you have to cross the river styx.
because, you see, nothing lasts forever in india, not even death.
if alexander's belief influenced his behavior, if the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior, then it was bound to influence the business they were in.
it's not about compliance. it's about setting, getting the job done, by bending or breaking the rules -- just look at your indian people around here, you'll see them smile; they know what it is.
i would give my viewpoints to people.
because you don't know whether you're right or wrong, and so all you seek is divine empathy.
varuna has but a thousand eyes.
then, your other excuse is, "yes, there are special people who pursue their passions, but they are geniuses.
you found something you're interested in.
yes he did.
course, i had to tell him that the building was for adults only and to get out.
but then you were born. "
in this funny and blunt talk, larry smith pulls no punches when he calls out the absurd excuses people invent when they fail to pursue their passions. & lt; em & gt; & lt; / em & gt;
the radiologists were, in turn, criticized for protecting their own financial self-interest.
at the time my patient posed this question to me, breast density was an obscure topic in the radiology literature, and very few women having mammograms, or the physicians ordering them, knew about this.
this makes no sense, because physicians have all kinds of problems that they don't realize have solutions.
so how does this work?
and this corresponded to a tumor the size of a golf ball.
first, know your density.
deborah rhodes: a test that finds 3x more breast tumors, and why it's not available to you
when you come to my website, i actually know what you're going to do already because i've seen you visit millions of websites before.
let's do a show of hands -- iphone.
and from day to day, we have the techniques that we use.
favorite number. i love that number.
he thought ethics was a matter of making decisions in the here-and-now using our best judgment to find the right path.
and compared to the little pain that it's going to cause -- because it's going to be embarrassing when i'm looking on his phone and seeing that he has a farmville problem and that whole bit -- that's overwhelmed by the value of looking at the phone.
and that's uncomfortable.
what you just did, that's the first step towards taking responsibility for what we should do with all of our power.
we're moved because it's about the battle between good and evil, about right and wrong.
and it really helps me to understand how we see, how we hear, how we breathe, how our brain can inform or mislead us.
it seems to be magic.
this object is completely covered by fiber opticals.
so i wanted to create a new kind of medicine, in order to create a new kind of relationship between the patient and the treatment.
and when the kids wake up, he can see the object needs him. and he take him to his mouth, and breathe the air it contains.
and it was singing all day long. and when it stops it means that it just died.
this one is kind of the same approach because i include, in a product like andrea, some plants.
i wanted to create a perfect place where you can work and play, and where your body and your brain can work together.
first, i want to explain how and why crack cocaine had such a profound influence on inner-city gangs.
it was a brilliant way of getting the brain high.
so sudhir -- the suburban boy who had never really been in the inner city -- dutifully took his clipboard and, you know, walked down to this housing project.
it was one of the most unequal co-authoring relationships ever -- -- but i was glad to be the beneficiary of it.
so the same kids who are working in the gang were actually -- at a place like mcdonald's.
so it's a lot safer being on death row than it is selling drugs out on the street.
they just leased them -- because they couldn't afford to own the fancy cars.
they're going to come into your neighborhood.
and that's me in the background, carving around the whole formation in freefall also, with the helmet cam to film this jump.
everybody sitting in a basket, and i was on top of the balloon, ready to slide down with my skysurf board.
all right. well we will watch this space. but i have two more questions.
in the studio we do a lot of experiments.
and my idea was to make the space tangible.
and the water flows through the city with time.
if you stand still, the landscape doesn't necessarily tell you how big it is.
how do we create public space?
i'm the short one.
it's a scream for help, a last-ditch attempt for escape, and a common form of defense in the deep sea.
we miss him.
she was the daughter of a very, very famous dutch painter who had made his fame in england.
oh, a li la li la la la la li la la li la la la la la la la li la la la la li la la la la la li la la la la la la la la la li la la la la la you've been so kind and generous i don't know how you keep on giving. and for your kindness, i'm in debt to you. and for your selflessness, my admiration. and for everything you've done, you know i'm bound; i'm bound to thank for it la li la li la la la la li la la li la li la la la la li la la la la li la la la la la li la li la la la la li la la li la li la la and you now you've been so kind and... curb the enthusiasm, just a little bit.
and what i've used is a very simple research tool, a mirror, and we've gained great information, reflections of these animal minds.
this was a custom-made touch-screen keyboard.
sue savage-rumbaugh: can you play a grooming song?
so we started up this interspecies internet project.
ng: those are for you.
this is generated by a program that's looking at the connectivity of the internet, and how all the various networks are connected together.
what's next?
this is an image of me and my daughter holding the israeli flag.
so i don't know what to do, so my first reflex, as a graphic designer, is, you know, to show everybody what i'd just seen, and people started to see them and to share them, and that's how it started.
and it became really big at some point.
today the israel-loves-iran page is this number, 80,831, and two million people last week went on the page and shared, liked, i don't know, commented on one of the photos.
now people from iran, the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent, you know, their foot and half their faces, now they're sending their faces, and they're saying, "okay, no problem, we're into it. we are with you."
is the latest tower in london a gherkin or a sausage or a sex tool?
a very literal way of showing it is a project we did for a library and a hotel in copenhagen.
this is our two interpreters, sort of reading the architecture.
the great wall is the only thing that can be seen from the moon.
so the real mermaid, the real water, and the real bikes.
the house is sort of a distortion of a square block.
this idea that you can actually create, if not gold, then at least added value by mixing traditional ingredients, like normal apartments and normal parking, and in this case actually offer people the chance that they don't have to choose between a life with a garden or a life in the city.
so, you can say where an urban development normally happens at the expense of nature, in this case it's actually creating nature.
two billion people without sanitation.
to communicable diseases, it might be health clinics or mosquito nets.
it could be a family-size pizza; it could be a very individual-size pizza, right?
they prioritize.
so the guy in bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106.
basically, the model showed that if we could get free trade, and especially cut subsidies in the u.s. and europe, we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year, half of which would accrue to the third world.
but of course, we don't do all problems.
it's not about making things that have the most media attention, but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good.
they all come out with very much the same list.
however, to many who live in the emerging markets, this is an illusion, and even though the universal declaration of human rights, which was signed in 1948, was unanimously adopted, what it did was to mask a schism that has emerged between developed and developing countries, and the ideological beliefs between political and economic rights.
today, it's closer to 82 percent.
and only if your per capita income is above 6,000 dollars a year will you have democracy come hell or high water.
in fact, there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law.
the developed world holds up the ideals of capitalism, democracy and political rights for all. those in emerging markets often don't have that luxury. in this powerful talk, economist dambisa moyo makes the case that the west can't afford to rest on its laurels and imagine others will blindly follow. instead, a different model, embodied by china, is increasingly appealing. a call for open-minded political and economic cooperation in the name of transforming the world.
if you have manageable health problems it doesn't really matter.
i'll figure something out.
in this case also because it's part of one of the many sentiments that we build the whole series on -- that all the sentiments originally had come out of the diary.
so the bath on the left is after five days, and on the right, after 10.
possibly a good performance piece, but definitely not ideal for everyday wear.
suzanne lee.
all of these speakers, by the way, are young women, 18 or 19 years old.
how much money can i save?
their relationship with the product of their labor was more complicated, surprising and funny than he could have imagined.
they usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade.
we've obtained a propaganda video made by the taliban.
so they beat these children -- i have seen it; they feed them twice a day dried bread and water; they rarely allow them to play games; they tell them that, for eight hours at a time, all they have to do is read the koran.
soc: what blessing would you get from carrying out a suicide attack?
and we are much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon, under the south pole, an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms.
and this seemed astounding. the internet is a transcendent idea. it's a set of protocols that has changed everything from shopping to dating to revolutions.
and in this dimension, they are incredibly small.
and he said there was coming soon, depending on the weather, but he'd let me know when, and so with about four days notice, he said to go to this beach south of lisbon, and a little after 9, this guy will walk out of the water.
and the reason we can do this is through an emerging technology called additive manufacturing, or 3d printing.
so all these products that you can see on the screen were made in the same way.
architects, for example, they want to create prototypes of buildings.
they're also now small enough to sit on a desktop.
in fact, every major household name is allowing you to interact with their products on a daily basis -- all the way from smart cars to prada to ray ban, for example.
so we can run this through to something like prosthetics, which is highly specialized to an individual's handicap.
to the vast majority of practicing muslims, jihad is an internal struggle for the faith.
they had heard bin laden say that that was jihad, and claimed victory for it. and so the old imam worried that his words were falling on deaf ears. no one was paying attention.
they even use the brand name he created for his jihad.
we know how to fight it now.
but many of these other factors that were in play are now even stronger than before. half the work is already done.
because really, it's a condition about choice, and the lack of freedom.
so she was again in mathare, with no income, no skill set, no money.
and in the next couple of weeks, she's going to be among the first 200 families to move into this development.
a few years ago, i felt like i was stuck in a rut, so i decided to follow in the footsteps of the great american philosopher, morgan spurlock, and try something new for 30 days.
no, no, if i want to, i can say, "i'm a novelist."
and i said, "no, it's a stirling engine. it really is."
i tried to figure out -- maybe solar's become attractive.
they take all the parallel incoming rays and focus it to a single spot.
so we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to try and convert sunlight to electricity, or heat to electricity.
but if you're trying to generate solar energy in a static place the weight doesn't matter so much.
so he made fine wires, and cracked glass, and all different kinds of materials to be a heat sponge.
so this is a unit with the 12 petals these petals cost about a dollar each -- they're lightweight, injection molded plastic, aluminized.
you don't have to have enough units to power your entire house, you just save money with each incremental one you add.
right now, solar paybacks are between 30 and 50 years.
that report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries.
i recently joined a field campaign in malaysia. there are others.
thank you very much.
well, tibor really started the studio, called m & amp; co.
but the painting reflects -- i don't think differently for children than i do for adults.
who are these people? what are these tribes?
so, i commissioned a wonderful composer, nico muhly, who wrote nine songs using the text, and we performed this fantastic evening of -- he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals.
which i think i made up, which is a good thing.
and he says, "it is impossible not to lie.
gershwin died at the age of 38.
all of the plans for me were already made.
that's wonderful, but we should also remember that we should have a similar process happening on the inside.
td: so i think that sincere motivation is very important for our future well-being, or deep sense of well-being as humans, and i think that means sinking in to whatever it is you're doing now.
so we threw in -- we created a primordial soup with lots of pieces of robots -- with bars, with motors, with neurons.
so, initially nothing happens, they're just flipping around there.
in domestic birds, especially chickens, it's 100 percent lethal.
and in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets, we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu: seizures, central nervous system disorders, partial paralysis.
most of these people don't actually know what their job will be.
we have no uniform policies regarding quarantine across the united states.
and tamiflu. you've probably heard of this drug, made by hoffmann-la roche, patented drug.
but by the time the second wave hit it took such a toll among the healthcare workers that we lost most of our doctors and nurses that were on the front lines.
do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the 1950s people viewed the civil defense issue, and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu?
lg: the moment that you see any evidence of serious human-to-human to transmission.
it's curious that there is no evidence of mass die-offs of chickens or household birds across america before the human pandemic happened.
but it's not bacterial pneumonia.
so next time you think about a vehicle, i hope, like us, you're thinking about something new.
now that manipulation was broken down into seven moves described over seven pages.
anyway, here i was progressing with my new clubs.
so i found some enormous, ridiculous, giant ski boots and then wobbly, wobbly i get on the ropes.
on one side, a mass of a mountain, a life i know.
now i have done the impossible not once, but many times.
but the dove, who obviously didn't go to flying school, goes flop, flop, flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole.
and whenever he's daunted by an impossible situation to solve in this hard-to-manage city, instead of giving up, he looks at the picture and he says, "if philippe can do that, i can do this," and he goes back to work.
4,000 of those ants live exclusively in the forest canopy.
so, recolonization is really very slow.
-- that we've taken this pop icon and we have just tweaked her a little bit to become an ambassador who can carry the message that being a woman scientist studying treetops is actually a really great thing.
in the pacific northwest, there's a whole industry of moss-harvesting from old-growth forests.
and so, i think for many reasons -- ecological, social, economic and perhaps even spiritual -- this has been a tremendous project and i'm really looking forward to not only myself and my students doing it, but also to promote and teach other scientists how to do this.
the children looked and were amazed.
obviously the church weren't very happy about this, and they tried to suppress it, but what they hadn't counted on was technology, and then they had the printing press, which suddenly enabled these ideas to spread cheaply, far and fast, and people would come together in coffee houses, discuss the ideas, plot revolution.
it's a place where your data can be free, so when we think about, increasingly, how governments want to access user data, what they're trying to do in iceland is make this safe haven where it can happen.
at the moment our rights are incredibly weak.
thank you.
so, to go deeper, most biologists have turned to submersibles.
the first limitation is the oxygen -- oxygen toxicity.
we needed more time.
so we need another gas, something to dilute the oxygen with.
people have asked me, "it must take a long time to get there?"
richard pyle: when you start talking like donald duck, there's no situation in the world that can seem tense.
but, it's much more than that.
what's extraordinary about this is not just the sheer number of species we're finding -- although as you can see that's pretty amazing, this is only half of what we've found -- what's extraordinary is how quickly we find them.
so, you can't live your life in fear.
and then i came across a team at harvard university that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it, instead of in brain research, towards diagnosing brain disorders in children.
and for too long, these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation.
i think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental, and perhaps not planned at all.
fg: yeah, when he was in rome.
no, he never saw this.
so, my question: are we alone?
so, what exactly is seti?
but those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe.
we are not the pinnacle of evolution.
the ata is the first telescope built from a large number of small dishes, and hooked together with computers.
the first step would be to tap into the global brain trust, to build an environment where raw data could be stored, and where it could be accessed and manipulated, where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient.
nowhere on earth offers us such a perfect record.
more importantly, they prepare it for inspection and analysis by 27 independent laboratories in the united states and europe, who will examine it for 40 different trace chemicals related to climate, some in parts per quadrillion.
the scientists must insure that the ice is not contaminated.
now, similarly, the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it, it would be expensive, or we would have done it already, because markets are essentially perfect.
the question is, who will make them?
you can sort of have it all with these things.
for example, we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites in sporting goods.
so you end up with at least two-fifths lower capital intensity than the leanest plant in the industry, which gm has in lansing.
and detroit will make money on every unit.
they would have been gone if we'd kept that up one more year.
and interval research is kind of the living example of how that can be true.
we've made half-a-billion impressions with marketing and pr for this brand, purple moon.
girl 11: because my older sister, she gets everything and, like, when i ask my mom for something, she'll say, "no" -- all the time.
if we were playing the game, that's what we'd do.
and like hitler, goering fancied himself a collector of art.
now goering was, by all accounts, a terrible man.
i want to suggest that this is true, not just for how we think about things, but how we react to things.
it's not just that you say it's more pleasurable, you say you like it more, you really experience it in a different way.
of course, it was the same man, but she was seeing him in different ways.
that causes a huge drop in the value.
when this came out on television, the value of her art dropped to nothing.
one lovely experiment was done by kurt gray and dan wegner.
and these are just some of the examples.
but we're also unimpressed by authority, because it's so easy to contrive.
and here's another example.
so this is what they were going to do in their trial.
what i find really fascinating is that the pharmaceutical industry uses exactly the same kinds of tricks and devices, but slightly more sophisticated versions of them, in order to distort the evidence that they give to doctors and patients, and which we use to make vitally important decisions.
how can we explain this strange phenomenon?
this is a drug that i myself have prescribed to patients.
we cannot make decisions in the absence of all of the information.
and then i asked myself the question.
and you've got to feel that.
and you know why they have a design?
when he was gassing the kurds and gassing iran, they didn't care about it.
well, obviously, when people die in the war, they are muslims, they are iraqis -- they're not americans.
if they won't submit, kill them.
i mean, these christians, they're nuts. how would they do this to their little kids? "
and of course, most of you don't support the insurgency; you don't support killing americans; you don't support the terrorists.
it's an american, american soldiers, american woman who lost her loved one in the middle east -- in iraq or afghanistan.
can you go there?
i'm not saying that i support the terrorists in iraq, but as a sociologist, what i am saying is i understand.
and perhaps most remarkably, at the beginning of the 21st century, really for the first time in modern history, growth extended to almost all parts of the world.
now this is not new. this is practically not new to tedsters.
the way i like to put this is: one idea. ideas are meant to be shared, so one idea can serve one world, one market.
india is coming on line.
but some of our grandchildren probably will.
you can see this in the data.
out of that broader study has emerged a concern and an ambition, crystallized in the wish that i'm about to make to you.
it's been estimated that a single ton of soil -- fertile soil -- contains approximately four million species of bacteria, all unknown.
we do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin are capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature and other harsh changes in environment, including hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the pyrex vessels around the growing population of bacteria.
only about 15 percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status.
i wish you would help them.
the carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere.
all she needed from those specimens at the smithsonian was a little bit of toe pad tissue, because down in there is what is called ancient dna.
so this meeting in boston led to three things.
this one had a malformed lung and died after 10 minutes, but alberto was confident that cloning has moved along well since then, and this will move ahead, and eventually there will be a population of bucardos back in the mountains in northern spain.
and so the red list is really important, keep track of what's endangered and critically endangered, and so on.
you know, do you want extinct species back?
well it feels like both the conversation and the potential here are pretty thrilling.
when i was in the third grade, a monumental event happened.
now when i was in sixth grade, the public funding all but eliminated the arts budgets in the worcester public school system.
and i thought, "oh no. he thinks it's a note."
i had this book that was how to draw comics in the marvel way, and it taught me how to draw superheroes, how to draw a woman, how to draw muscles just the way they were supposed to be if i were to ever draw for x-men or spiderman.
and i said, "no one, no one, no one just yet.
and i got this picture, and i thought, "this picture is going to live within his consciousness for his entire life. he will forever have this photo in his family photo albums."
when jarrett j. krosoczka was a kid, he didn't play sports, but he & lt; em & gt; loved & lt; / em & gt; art. he paints the funny and touching story of a little boy who pursued a simple passion: to draw and write stories. with the help of a supporting cast of family and teachers, our protagonist grew up to become the successful creator of beloved children's book characters, and a vocal advocate for arts education. & lt; em & gt; & lt; / em & gt;
and the quality of sleep is degraded, and so is our recovery.
now that education you would receive, and thanks to the british acoustician adrian james for those simulations. the signal was the same, the background noise was the same.
out of that conference, incidentally, also came a free app which is designed to help children study if they're having to work at home, for example, in a noisy kitchen.
because of poor acoustics, students in classrooms miss 50 percent of what their teachers say and patients in hospitals have trouble sleeping because they continually feel stressed. julian treasure sounds a call to action for designers to pay attention to the "invisible architecture" of sound.
so today, i would like to talk to you about the relationship between theater and technology.
it's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box as it is about taking theater out of its box.
there is a revolution in the way that we think, in the way that we share, and the way that we express our stories, our evolution.
and i followed this one pig with number "05049," all the way up until the end and to what products it's made of.
and then in paintbrushes, hairs are used because, apparently, they're very suitable for making paintbrushes because of their hard-wearing nature.
the low-tech bit is that it's literally a pig's heart valve mounted in the high-tech bit, which is a memory metal casing.
it's either poverty, low attendance, negative peer influences. we know why.
they said, "that's okay, ms. pierson.
he said, "then why'd you put a smiley face?"
teaching and learning should bring joy.
let me start off with a technical problem in language that i've worried about for quite some time -- and indulge me in my passion for verbs and how they're used.
so, "give the x to the y," that construction corresponds to the thought "cause x to go to y." whereas "give the y the x" corresponds to the thought "cause y to have x."
it evokes the container metaphor of communication, in which we conceive of ideas as objects, sentences as containers, and communication as a kind of sending.
and likewise, if someone says, "nice store you've got there. it would be a real shame if something happened to it" -- -- we understand that as a veiled threat, rather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities.
if you express your request as a conditional -- "if you could open the window, that would be great" -- even though the content is an imperative, the fact that you're not using the imperative voice means that you're not acting as if you're in a relationship of dominance, where you could presuppose the compliance of the other person.
in an exclusive preview of his book & lt; i & gt; the stuff of thought & lt; / i & gt;, steven pinker looks at language and how it expresses what goes on in our minds -- and how the words we choose communicate much more than we realize.
it's no skin off my back whether you think functionalism is a viable theory of mind.
that's the kind of argument we want.
and you answer my objection.
i don't have an answer.
and what they do for their courtship dance is, they go together, the two of them, the two mates, and they begin to run underwater.
and they said, calcium carbonate.
so it's the conscious emulation of life's genius.
and thirdly, how does life make things disappear into systems?
imagine being able to make perfect lenses.
and that's an up-close picture of a lotus leaf.
a guy named bruce rosner looked at the tardigrade -- which dries out completely, and yet stays alive for months and months and months, and is able to regenerate itself.
we should be growing fertility. and, oh yes -- we get food, too.
i had left abc news and a career i loved at the age of 30 for business school, a path i knew almost nothing about.
i went on to bosnia, and early on in my interviews i met with an imf official who said, "you know, gayle, i don't think we actually have women in business in bosnia, but there is a lady selling cheese nearby on the side of the road.
nearly everywhere i go, i meet incredibly interesting entrepreneurs who are seeking access to finance, access to markets and established business networks.
so the great news is this is an incredible opportunity.
and all around the world are not exceptions.
history would know lothar meggendorfer as -- who else? -- the world's first true inventor of the children's pop-up book.
and i really want to build green, but i'm very suspicious of all of these well-meaning articles, people long on moral authority and short on data, telling me how to do these kinds of things.
we wanted to know how much better we could do.
now, i probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy-efficient, and in that case, it would take me more about 20 years to break even.
and after 10 years of this, my wife eventually said, "look, you know, you gotta do this thing you've been talking about, and build the vending machine."
and i'll give you an example of that.
some students went out and netted some crows, brought them in, and were -- weighed them, and measured them and whatnot, and then let them back out again.

i told him only that he had killed one man, not two.
in fact, right now -- plug it from here, and then plug it in here, and now let's see if it gets my facial expressions.
so we put his writings, letters, his interviews, correspondences, into a huge database of thousands of pages, and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him.
first, there's this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out-of-the-box thinking.

but the point is, if the feature you're observing can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the wider landscape of reality, then thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided.
the fuel is based on something called a quantum field, but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it's virtually impossible to use it all up, which means in the inflationary theory, the big bang giving rise to our universe is likely not a one-time event.
or would they believe in the black, static empty universe that their own state-of-the-art observations reveal?
is there more than one universe? in this visually rich, action-packed talk, brian greene shows how the unanswered questions of physics have led to the theory that our own universe is just one of many in the "multiverse."
and you're able to interact with his world.
milo: i could just squish it.
how do you skim stones?
now's a chance for dimitri to kind of reassure and calm milo down.

how do we know this?
but in fact, it turns out that some time around 200,000 years ago, when our species first arose and acquired social learning, that this was really the beginning of our story, not the end of our story.
and we take this utterly for granted, because we're a species that is so at home with language, but you have to realize that even the simplest acts of exchange that we engage in are utterly dependent upon language.
and so we prospered in a way that no other animal has.

one way to think about that is by counting planets.
treating people as machines may be scientifically and philosophically accurate, but it's a cumbersome waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next.
we were looking forward to rebuilding it, but eight months after we moved in, i suffered a stroke-like attack caused by a birth defect.
it was then i realized that i could also use an aerial drone to expand the worlds of bedridden people through flight, giving a sense of movement and control that is incredible.

my interest in acting, especially bad acting, goes a long way.
in this case, it's very simple.
there is, for example, a project that's underway to sequence a thousand individuals -- their genomes -- from different parts of the world.
there were other forms of humans around, most famously perhaps, neanderthals -- these robust forms of humans, compared to the left here with a modern human skeleton on the right -- that existed in western asia and europe since several hundreds of thousands of years.
if they then mixed with each other there, then those modern humans that became the ancestors of everyone outside africa carried with them this neanderthal component in their genome to the rest of the world.
what have we learned from studying genomes of present day humans and extinct humans?

well, we were confined though, limited, i should rather say, for several reasons that it's not worth explaining, to endoscopy only, of the many other options we had, and with a 4mm camera attached to it, we were successful in documenting and taking some fragments of what it turns out to be a reddish color, black color, and there is some beige fragments that later on we ran a much more sophisticated exams, xrf, x-ray diffraction, and the results are very positive so far. it seems to indicate that indeed we have found some pigments, and since we know for sure that no other artist has painted on that wall before vasari came in about 60 years later, well, those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting and most likely to leonardo.
well, our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the renaissance, create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together.
okay, induced pluripotent stem cells.

you follow this curve and you see the whiter spot in the middle -- that's your 50-year time bubble. humans, livestock and pets are now 97 percent of that integrated total mass on earth and all wild nature is three percent. we have won. the next generation doesn't even have to worry about this game -- it is over.

basically, prices soar and crooked politicians then milk the rents from the sector, but it doesn't generate any jobs.

farmers are facing challenges of drought from asia to africa, from australia to oklahoma, while heat waves linked with climate change have killed tens of thousands of people in western europe in 2003, and again in russia in 2010.
beyond these technical solutions, our work at the georgetown climate center with communities encourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available and to consider how they can accommodate change.
as vicki arroyo says, it's time to prepare our homes and cities for our changing climate, with its increased risk of flooding, drought and uncertainty. she illustrates this inspiring talk with bold projects from cities all over the world -- local examples of thinking ahead. & lt; a href = "http: / / www.ted.com / conversations / 14186 / live _ chat _ with _ ted _ speaker _ vic.html" & gt; read our q & amp; a with vicki arroyo. & lt; / a & gt;

so the yellow bar represents car seats, the orange bar lap-and-shoulder, and the red bar lap-only seatbelts.
it really is based on some impassioned pleas of parents whose children died after they turned two, which has led to the passage of all these laws -- not very much on data.

women gave poison to their babies, and watched foam come from their mouths as they died.

i asked them all.

this is a portrait of my daughter and myself.
in my shop where i studied, or learned, there was a traditional hierarchy of master, journeyman and learned worker, and apprentice, and i worked as the apprentice.
so as a journeyman, i put an ad into the paper that i had studied, that i was a down-to-earth potter's journeyman and i was looking for a job as a journeyman.

the reason you're not allowed to chart love is because we think of love as a binary thing.
that continued into the the hospital. it was really exhilarating.
and i realize, i think, the way i was feeling that way, is on a really deep gut level, i was feeling a lot of shame and embarrassed, frankly, that, in some respects, i had failed at delivering what i'm genetically engineered to do.
av: so you can imagine, i mean again, the first few months were difficult, but we'd come out of it, and were really shocked to see this study.

our societies now spend two, three, four percent of gdp to invest systematically in new discovery, in science, in technology, to fuel the pipeline of brilliant inventions which illuminate gatherings like this.
and what people are beginning to ask is: surely, just as we invest in r and d, two, three, four percent, of our gdp, of our economy, what if we put, let's say, one percent of public spending into social innovation, into elder care, new kinds of education, new ways of helping the disabled?
and as that happens, we will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism, which is that, unlike what you read in economics textbooks, it's not a self-sufficient system.
let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ.
in some deep sense, chinese doesn't divide up the time spectrum in the same way that english forces us to constantly do in order to speak correctly.
what you see is that these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the oecd that speak futured languages.
and what i'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that i can measure, and then i'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these levels.
my linguistics and economics colleagues at yale and i are just starting to do this work and really explore and understand the ways that these subtle nudges cause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak.
well i don't know.
i don't think so.
and i want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand did not have to have english, they didn't have to pass an english test.
but if another language can think that thought, then, by cooperating, we can achieve and learn so much more.
while this was all going on, i was in the field of weather modification, although getting a ph.d. in aeronautics.
but while this was going on, in 1982, i got a prize from the lindbergh foundation -- their annual prize -- and i had to prepare a paper on it, which collected all my varied thoughts and varied interests over the years.
so this just summarizes it. "over billions of years, on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life -- complex and probable, wonderful and fragile.

the dalai lama often states that compassion is his best friend.
and the man said, "really?" and he showed him a dish full of needles.
that's it. i'm a useless person and there's no buddha, no maitreya, and everything is all hopeless.
and so he looked very dubious, asanga did.
and then the buddhists, of course, think that, because we've all had infinite previous lives, we've all been each other's relatives, actually.
and you think of him as nursing you.
if your enemy was really happy, why would they bother to be your enemy?
and so the next step -- the sixth step beyond "universal compassion" -- is this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way, and you have compassion for yourself also, and it isn't sentimental only. you might be in fear of something.
it's hard to always show compassion -- even to the people we love, but robert thurman asks that we develop compassion for our enemies. he prescribes a seven-step meditation exercise to extend compassion beyond our inner circle.

one option is the fast food fetish.
so these robots are related to unmanned aerial vehicles.
so one of the advantages of this design is, when you scale things down, the robot naturally becomes agile.
so one of the problems with these small robots is their payload carrying capacity.
and here you'll see daniel throw this hoop into the air, while the robot is calculating the position of the hoop and trying to figure out how to best go through the hoop.
plus the robots have to base their actions only on local information, what they sense from their neighbors.
so all these experiments you've seen thus far, all these demonstrations, have been done with the help of motion capture systems.

i started looking at wheelchairs in developing countries in 2005, when i spent the summer assessing the state of technology in tanzania, and i talked to wheelchair users, wheelchair manufacturers, disability groups, and what stood out to me is that there wasn't a device available that was designed for rural areas, that could go fast and efficiently on many types of terrain.
the first is that this product works well because we were effectively able to combine rigorous engineering science and analysis with user-centered design focused on the social and usage and economic factors important to wheelchair users in the developing countries.

now, that's great, except we had him at age 44.
so these are the gentleman who played benjamin.

she was 11 years old; her parents had both died from aids, her mother and then her father.
that global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work, but we should not lose the chance in this generation, in this decade in particular, with president obama in america, with other people working with us around the world, to create global institutions for the environment, and for finance, and for security and for development, that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples, our desire to bind the world together, and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist.

watch its feet.
it just extrudes.
and here's the first attempt to have it work on some load.

now, that movie is set in 2054, about 40 years from now, and as exciting as that technology looks, it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about you, and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect.

let me talk about the other thing i'm excited about.
someone's offering 10 million dollars to go and do this thing.
we're free to choose where we make the fold.
the forms that i showed before were made actually through very long trial and error.
the more interesting question, perhaps, is, are these forms imaginable?

today we know the molecular cause of 4,000 diseases, but treatments are available for only 250 of them. so what's taking so long? geneticist and physician francis collins explains why systematic drug discovery is imperative, even for rare and complex diseases, and offers a few solutions -- like teaching old drugs new tricks.
and therefore tradition becomes more important, not less important.

and so what we do is, we start simple and we work our way up to living systems.
so just through self-assembly, mixing things together in the lab, we can come up with, say, a metabolic surface with some informational molecules attached inside of this membrane body, right?
so then we put these protocells together in a single experiment to see what they would do, and depending on the conditions, we have some protocells on the left that are moving around and it likes to touch the other structures in its environment.
think of it like a primordial ooze, okay?
basically what that means is, you have an input of energy into the system that life can use and exploit to maintain itself.

they're usually parked within 100 feet of the people that own them.
the growth of the auto industry will be capped by sustainability issues if we don't solve the problems.
and eventually, i ended up at a school where there was a mixture.
and this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids and getting to know exactly what they're going through, getting to know their families -- i wanted that, but i couldn't do it in a school with 1,600 kids, and teachers turning over year after year after year.

emily levine: richard. what did i say?
i don't know if you know this but -- maybe it's different now, or maybe you were making a statement -- but in many hospital nurseries across the country, until very recently anyway, according to a book by jessica benjamin, the signs over the little boys cribs read, "i'm a boy," and the signs over the little girls cribs read, "it's a girl." yeah.

our whole practice depends on computing.
and i do believe that this interaction with the history, with history that is often very difficult, to grapple with it, to create a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique.

we found five -- five best matches, which we call the five foundations of morality.
and while the political right may moralize sex much more, the political left is really doing a lot of it with food.
here's the data for 1,100 canadians.
some of you might recognize this as the '60s.
some people think that religion is an adaptation evolved both by cultural and biological evolution to make groups to cohere, in part for the purpose of trusting each other, and then being more effective at competing with other groups.
this guy's shirt says, "stop bitching, start a revolution."
now unfortunately, it's a disease that has been caught by many of the world's leaders.
thank you.
this photo is actually from one of the missions in the balkans in the late 1990s.
so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different, and i think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non-lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police.
that spike was all victoria.
they'd released a bunch of people, but they still had about 700 people hostage.
it happened while i was working as a research fellow at the u.s. naval academy.
but i'd remind you what i'm talking about, i'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons.
it's a scraper bike; it's called -- from oakland.
and of course, we have fashion.
makers today, to some degree, are out on the edge.
he's just a kid that grew up playing with tools instead of toys.
and i don't know if you can see it that well, but that's a mailbox -- so an ordinary mailbox and an arduino.
think how much money and how many years it took nasa to get satellites into space.
well, it's certainly not this one.
glamour is a magic spell.
when you stack people in rows, the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground -- but not in the world of glamour.
glamour is all about transcending this world and getting to an idealized, perfect place.
of course, they covered that with make-up, because lara croft did all those same stunts -- but she doesn't get black and blue, because she has sprezzatura.
and i think if grace kelly is the most glamorous person, maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot, because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous.
is it something important?
and that's to take isaac mizrahi's advice and confront the manipulation of it all, and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy, but also enjoy how it happens.
me was a floating head.
i took more than my body had to offer.
i went to the democratic republic of congo.
and when it rains hard rain, i scream and i run in circles.
and as the warm gulf washed over my naked head, i realized that it held the best and the worst of us.
it was a lot of anger, insane humor, a lot of attention, outrage.
so, the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience is to stand with these ideas, one in each hand.
cheese? i love cheese!
so that's a five-year-old who clearly understands that other people can have false beliefs and what the consequences are for their actions.
um, yeah.
so we ask people, how much should grace be blamed in this case, which we call a failed attempt to harm?
so now i'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain, to the part of my brain that controls my hand.
so then seriously, you must lie awake at night sometimes wondering where this work leads.
i mean, what chances do you think there are that at some time in your career, someone, you or someone else, is going to come up with some paradigm shift in understanding what seems an impossible problem?
i mean, these are sort of the extreme examples, and they're amusing and good to laugh at.
and the second is, is it possible, or even desirable, to slow down?
i think also the explosion of the organic farming movement, and the renaissance of farmers' markets, are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable.
and europe is an example of that, and people finding that their quality of life improves as they're working less, and also that their hourly productivity goes up.
i think there are various reasons.
i play squash and ice hockey, two very fast sports, and i wouldn't give them up for the world.
carl honoré: in praise of slowness
a toroid, for those who don't know, is the surface of a doughnut or, for some of us, a bagel.
so, many years after that in 1998, i was on one of my monthly trips to jerusalem and i got a call from the foreign ministry saying, "we've got the chief minister of the punjab here.
and yad vashem needs to deal with three million visitors a year at this point.
and then as you enter it again, looking in all directions towards the city.
okay, i have no idea what we're going to play.
if you played an e.
and i know that i speak for all of us when i tell you that we don't take it for granted.
thank you.
do you see me simply smothered in cloth?
would the pakistanis please just stand up please?
and in the summer india heats up, gets very hot.
and then the adult, which comes after, lives for one or two months.
something like this, these are all this species globe skimmer.
so, why is it that every year millions of dragonflies, millions, millions of dragonflies turn up?
seemed a bit unlikely.
and then they tail off, there's a few, but that's it.
i know because we have reports from seychelles, which fit in as well, down here.
if they pass the maldives they might go and have a look, nothing there, they'll carry on.
it's only half the length of this one.
and then they strike out across the ocean, down to kenya.
and every one of these birds that makes the crossing from india to east africa eats insects, large insects, the size of dragonflies. thank you very much.
it was gone. they took my pro model off the shelf, which was essentially pronouncing you dead publicly.
there's something called a primo slide.
but there's this other aspect of it for wheelies, so check this out. there's a few tricks, again, how environment changes the nature of your tricks.
next. these guys. very similar community that's extremely conducive to innovation.
and it gives you that clarity of perspective of, man, i'm just me, and popularity, what does that really mean again? not much.
it's a real pleasure to be here.
you've got a plane that's thousands of feet up in the air, going at hundreds of miles an hour, and you're trying to drop an object, a bomb, towards some stationary target in the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover and all kinds of other impediments.
well god's will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war be reduced to as small an amount as possible.
but of course, what happens in real life?
and you know what, it's true; they actually can do that now.
95 percent of the people we kill need to be killed, right?
jackson browne: a song inspired by the ocean
africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time, due to the vagaries of plate tectonics, floating around the indian ocean.
you think you've got a tough job?
and it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint.
what's the take-home message?
we hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago, but basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough, getting very cold. the northern hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets.
but then 50, 60, 70 thousand years ago, somewhere in that region, all hell breaks loose. art makes its appearance.
which is a great question to be asked by national geographic.
so how are we doing on the project? we've got about 25,000 samples collected from indigenous people around the world.
that's hundreds of times as many species as there are on earth.
it's incredibly hot.
we have our first stars.
but not too little.
so the information spreads.
they accumulate information, they learn.
i hope you agree that this is a powerful story.
it's kind of a recent topic, at least in the u.s.
how many of you spend a thousand dollars a year on lotteries?
one third of americans.
self-control is not a problem in the future.
one percent check the box. the rest do nothing.
why have you taken our apple?
but what are we going to do about the monkeys and loss aversion?
message two is there's still a lot to do.
in the spirit of ted, we're bringing you something that has not been released.
we're taking calls live on stage here at ted in monterey.
this song is called "the alphabet...
so how many people who saw the film did not get that here was a woman in love, that she was completely innocent and saw great joy in her life, and she was youthful?
you're looking for something that comes and hits you.
and he said, "son, it goes on forever."
so einstein told a story and followed his stories and came up with theories and came up with theories and then came up with his equations.
find the truth for yourself, and when you find the truth for yourself, there will be a truth in it, but it may contradict the plot, but don't worry about it. "
and she's recognizing the dangers of mortality and why she should break away from mortality.
elizabeth: bitch!
but that's the moment she's surgically removing herself from that.
so, from that mythology, the upper city and lower city come.
harmony is the suggestion of a thing that is much larger than resolution.
now this is god's work, but it's not my work.
because the people who were gathering brazil nuts weren't the same people who were cutting the forests.
now we're at 1.3.
we can get productivity up.
and there are many others.
are we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers?
after 40 years, the global organic movement has achieved 0.7 of one percent of global food.
and in the next 18 months, we will have signed up to work with another 40, and we think we'll get those signed as well.
they're doing it with ibm and the usda, and they're putting it in the public domain because they want everybody to have access to this data, because they want everybody to help them make cocoa more productive and more sustainable.
thank you.
i knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor, reggie edgerton, to share my new idea.
and it then became obvious from me that we had to move away from the classical rehabilitation paradigm, stepping on a treadmill, and develop conditions that would encourage the brain to begin voluntary control over the leg.
it occurred throughout the central nervous system, including in the brain stem, where we observed up to 300-percent increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain.
and remember, we are only as great as our imagination, as big as our dream.
he was grateful for what he had.
we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like.
if you want to know the reason why i'm standing here, it's because of education.
and i hope in pursuing your dreams, you all remain resolute, that you go forward without limits, and that you use your talents -- because there are many; we've seen them; it's there -- that you use them to create the world as it should be.
i can't make noise.
it's "aria" of john cage.
they had none of that.
you need a lot of trust, but it's not like, "i'm trying to get to pensacola, please."
now just think about that.
the wiki was introduced so others could make suggestions on edits -- as almost an afterthought, a back room.
it does make you wonder if there were, for instance, a massive, extremely popular star trek convention one weekend, who would be minding the store?
this is my favorite goofy blog: catsthatlooklikehitler.com.
it said, "can you help me get there?"
it's saying, "let's march." thank you very much.
and once hotly contested, our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard.
but let's step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started pisa, and i'm giving them a colored bubble now.
so you ask yourself, if education has become so much more expensive, has it become so much better?
portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system, raise quality and improve equity, and so did hungary.
if i'm not born as a genius in math, i'd better study something else.
the high-performing systems have helped teachers and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher, the next school around their lives.
i mean, there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs.
if citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive, so that their voices are heard, so then things would improve.
if you just multiply by 100 million people, let's say losing one day a month, whatever, and you see a vast amount of resource wasted.
that leads to productivity.
but that's why i noticed grameen bank, which is a bank for poor people, and had 1,100 branches, 12,000 employees, 2.3 million borrowers.
you can see it's pretty much covered.
they are very eager learners and very capable survivors.
but in st. john's, i was in the lower quarter.
because 1858 was also watershed year in the history of asia.
and they were also, by the end of the century, getting healthy, and japan was starting to catch up.
you can see that the health started to improve.
and it's healthier than the united states.
we have an enormous disparity in the world.
and there is no doubt that fast catch up can take place.
hans rosling: asia's rise -- how and when
in other words, if we measured speed as a function of distance -- this is the only time i'm going to show a graph, ok -- we would expect that it goes down as the distance increases from the center of the galaxy.
and suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe.
if they're slightly skewed, we'll see a different image.
so the streaks that you see, all these streaks, are actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away.
so, in the last century, ok, people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever; whether it would slow down, you know, will be slowing down, but continue forever; slow down and stop, asymptotically stop; or slow down, stop, and then reverse, so it starts to contract again.
i mean that we have mathematically consistent theories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon, ok, things that i haven't even talked about, that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting, new particle.
tommy mizzone: thank you very much.
sadly, it's come true. malaria, as we all know, kills approximately one million people a year.
in all schools in indonesia, there is usually a toy seller in the playground.
so i want to talk to you today about aids in sub-saharan africa.
and in fact among gay men in the us we did see that kind of change in the 1980s.
so malaria is a disease that kills you.
the reason that we know that the abc campaign was effective in uganda is we have good data on prevalence over time.
and you see they have pretty similar death rates among young kids and old people.
it's good for improving people's lives.
but there was actually something else that happened in uganda in this period.
so thank you very much.
and there was a wasp's nest that i had let grow in my yard, right outside my door.
this is a story about an engineer at j.r. west.
this is a little critter that's in the namibian desert.
it's actually a company a company that i'm involved in called onesun, with paul hawken.
nanotechnology, nanoparticles, you hear a lot of worry about this.
these wind turbines can rotate in incredibly slow windspeeds, as a result.
and hopefully, any inventor, anywhere in the world, will be able, in the moment of creation, to type in, "how does nature remove salt from water?"
well, their answer was, "it's all about risk and reward."
let me begin with my parents.
and the second thing, which has stayed with me, which became my philosophy of life, which made all the difference, is: 100 things happen in your life, good or bad.
i didn't want to make it different from the men, but it was different, because this was the way i was different.
the first day when i went in, i didn't know how to look at them.
everything was donated, because there was no budget of education for the prison.
this was a sensitive box.
so this is an example from the yahoo registration page.
so can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds?
we don't tell you which one's which, and we say, please type both.
so this actually has given rise to a really big internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in, which is called captcha art.
yeah, i can trust you'll do that.
actually it was a forum post.
so what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people translating the web into every major language for free.
but at all times, you're learning by doing.
since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users, we're hopeful that we'll be able to translate extremely fast with this project.
but what zipcar really did was make sharing the norm.
i met these founders just weeks after they had launched, and now, in two years, what would you do for five dollars?
way too much money, i just can't even go there, with lawyers, trying to figure out how this is different, who's responsible to whom, and the result was that we were able to provide owners protection for their own driving records and their own history.
this would not be possible to do that in economic fashion for a traditional company.
according to this view, the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable.
and yet it's not clear what the relationship is between our use of this ability and our happiness.
we're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person, and so we can look and see, does mind-wandering tend to precede unhappiness, or does unhappiness tend to precede mind-wandering, to get some insight into the causal direction.
there was a beaten up black and white television flickering in the background, and a former head of state and general was being blindfolded and tied to the pole.
i mean, nor had ghana, even though we had been trying very hard.
and my heart sank, because i thought, here we are again.
i mean, at the absolute time for the absolute need of democracy, they did not abuse their power.
and when i went to find out something, i used scientific methods. i wasn't real surprised, you know, when they first told me how -- how you were supposed to do science, because i'd already been doing it for fun and whatever.
i make them all the time.
you didn't have to be a member then.
and the mathematics part and the experimental science part was pulling away from philosophy.
audience: here.
and so i -- i did some experiments.
and i'd better get permission from the government.
scientists, you know, made world war ii as we know it quite possible.
it should have been. but not a lot. not like, you know -- the first guy -- the first guy that got the idea that we're going to fry ourselves here, actually, he didn't think of it that way.
so the planet should get warmer.
i started to realize that i could look at the whole city as a living organism.
when i first went in, i was scared, because i heard dogs barking and i thought they were guard dogs.
i was there alone, setting up, and a homeless man approached.
this is the actual catacombs in paris.
and when the tides of waste matter come in it sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you.
and your next question is, can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery, a bulb and one piece of wire?
and so, there's a whole lot of people saying, "i'd be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air.
ok, now, the scribble of the diagram of the solar system.
so good interpretation is more about things that are bodged and stuffed and of my world, right?
so, why is it blue on cloudy days? ah, see.
think about evolution in terms of offspring competing, and some winning.
let's see if we can actually make life.
and the cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing.
and here we are.
and the answer, of course, lies with mice.
they're all made of the same stuff, but they want their shape to win.
evolution cannot be cut apart.
lc: hopefully within the next two years.
and there's not even statistics on africa to know what is happening. "
and all these colored lines here are results; each color is one survey.
i would say, at least do this -- 10 years is enough to follow the trend.
in the 90s, only 1.2 percent, only 1.2 percent.
it's very strange. it's sort of embarrassing.
and they got safer water, they eradicated malaria.
and here brazil is in the western box.
look -- even if we look in africa -- these are the african countries.
you can get a mercedes for a very high price, very high performance.
innovation, compassion and passion.
but who was the team leader?
and what happened was that -- more from less -- you can see how much more for how much less.
unfortunately, that's not the case in india.
an incredible story.
cost of development -- 300 million dollars.
and mind you, it is not getting just a little more for just a little less.
their heart is in the right place, like ratan tata.
and there was a bright spot up there.
lp: thank you very much.
this is so i can share my experiences with others.
in a nuclear power plant, you have a big pot of water that's under high pressure, and you have some fuel rods, and these fuel rods are encased in zirconium, and they're little pellets of uranium dioxide fuel, and a fission reaction is controlled and maintained at a proper level, and that reaction heats up water, the water turns to steam, steam turns the turbine, and you produce electricity from it.
it's still thermally hot but it's not radioactive.
also, they operate at high temperatures, and the fuel is molten, so they can't melt down, but in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances, or you lost off-site power in the case of something like fukushima, there's a dump tank.
that could power a rocket there.
commoditized: where they're treated like a commodity, where people don't care who makes them.
you americans.
getting the commodities to market.
and of course, if you are both true to yourself, and are what you say you are, then you're real real!
and what you have done in the past limits what you can do, what you can get away with, essentially, in the future.
two or three cents per cup -- that's what coffee is worth.
so that was how i first started to explore the way things moved, and expressed it.
and i started to make him walk across the table, and i thought, "oh, i can make a little machine that will do that."
so, this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil.
it would be -- whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner.
i was offered a position as associate professor of medicine and chief of scientific visualization at yale university in the department of medicine.
but as you can see, when you actually start working on this data, it's pretty spectacular.
we're actually doing the launch of two new studies of actually scanning babies' brains from the moment they're born.
but you have it in planets and asteroids.
we can actually study line-of-sight velocities of cosmic objects.
and i couldn't sleep, next two weeks, when i saw the huge amount of oxygen and other elements in the spectrum of the stars.
and doing this for 14 billion years, we end up with this picture, which is a very important graph, showing relative abundances of chemical elements in sun-like stars and in the interstellar medium.
it's too much energy on a planet.
so it's something which you can always refer to seti and say, "well, somebody must be doing this, somehow."
garik israelian: how spectroscopy could reveal alien life
when i was a young researcher, doctoral student, my first year i had a research professor who said to us, "here's the thing, if you cannot measure it, it does not exist."
so very quickly -- really about six weeks into this research -- i ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that i didn't understand or had never seen.
and that was, the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging.
they didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable, nor did they really talk about it being excruciating -- as i had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing.
and i said, "i'm great. i'm okay."
i lost the fight, but probably won my life back.
god.
which just, i hope in 100 years, people will look back and go, "wow."
that's all i have. thank you.
it has just that sensor in it.
and the self isn't the only thing; it's not even most things.
all of our statuses are different.
and i'm going to show you what patients like me, the company that myself, my youngest brother and a good friend from mit started.
this amazing data allows us to drill down and see what this drug is for -- 1,500 people on this drug, i think. yes.
i don't want to just look at this cool device, i want to take this data and make something even better.
but the short story is: if you're a patient, you want to be on the blue line.
can we find out what's going to happen to you, so that you can maybe change it? "
you're actually doing slightly worse -- not significantly, but slightly worse. you don't want to be a lithium patient this time.
it only works about 12 months.
that same word, "normal," had two different, almost opposite meanings.
one of the things about working at the nanoscale is things look and act very differently.
we talked about generating and using.
it was taken by kevin carter who went to the sudan to document their famine there.
it gets worse.
and it gets even better, because most complex systems have this amazing property called emergence.
how are they organized? are they isolated?
if you have more than 50 percent of the shares in a company, you get control, but usually it depends on the relative distribution of shares.
it's an emergent property which depends on the rules of interaction in the system, so it's probably not the result of a top-down approach like a global conspiracy.
today at the micro- and nanoscales, there's an unprecedented revolution happening.
and the idea is that you take the three-dimensional structure of a protein -- in this case it's the crambin protein -- you take the backbone -- so no cross-linking, no environmental interactions -- and you break that down into a series of components.
so you completely print this part, and it can transform into something else.
imagine if water pipes could expand or contract to change capacity or change flow rate, or maybe even undulate like peristaltics to move the water themselves.
i said, "amy, amy, wait. don't cry. don't cry.
but if i'm interested in potential, if i'm interested in your potential, or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity, what we're doing is we're creating the cult of the average with science.
and if we can change the lens, not only can we change your happiness, we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time.
so every year, instead of just teaching our students, we also have a wellness week.
if you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present, then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage, which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than it does at negative, neutral or stressed.
who has a computer? yeah.
and that was torture, real torture.
and isn't it that strange moment when you publish your design?
and i said, never.
so, she wears the disk, and reads the data off the sectors of the disk, and the computer starts up; it sort of boots up, really.
i remember, like, we'd be in his studio, like, at 2 a.m., and then he'd show up from some client meeting.
so, i was wondering, like, what is this thing in front of me, this computer thing?
the world is just so tasty.
however, recently this risd opportunity kind of arose -- going to risd -- and i couldn't reconcile this real easy, because the letters had told me, mit forever.
first, i want to start by saying, this is a boy, and this is a girl, and this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl.
this makes university administrators very nervous, because girls don't want to go to schools that don't have boys.
and little moments in my life.
the answer to that question changes depending on who's sitting around that table.
we need to put ourselves into boy culture.
and they're always talking about this stuff. "
of course, the verdict is not definitive.
for instance, the tunnel diode, a component used in electronics, works thanks to the wonders of quantum tunneling.
so it is really unlikely that we will be around to see the higgs field collapse.
but whichever it turns out to be, there is one thing i'm sure of: the journey will be full of surprises.
obviously, one of the most important things was the sheep, and so my job was, well, pretty much to do everything, but it was about bringing the sheep back to the homestead.
why didn't you come here in the first place? "
so it was trying to make you look after something in your immediate environment, which you don't want to see not looking so good, rather than expecting people to do things in the local environment because of the effect that it has a long way off.
so that's pretty much what i do.
but something about the first piece, the animali chordata piece, kept coming back to me, this idea of interaction with art, and i really liked the idea of people being able to interact, and also being challenged by interacting with art.
using video mapping and projection, artist gabriel barcia-colombo captures and shares his memories and friendships. at fellow he shows his charming, thoughtful work -- which appears to preserve the people in his life in jars, suitcases, blenders...
a sport pilot can be certificated in as little as 20 hours of flight time.
radio 2: that was gorgeous.
instead of paying to keep your airplane in a hanger, park it in your garage.
now what is the hedonic opportunity cost on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks?
so, actually, he tried making it compulsory.
second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion.
coca-cola. a bunch of you may be a load of pinkos, and you may not like the coca-cola company, but it's worth remembering andy warhol's point about coke.
he actually invented the toasty. but then, the earl of toasty would be a ridiculous name.
it's kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown.
so, eventually, the manufacturers actually arrived at a compromise, which was the combo pack.
a bit better.
remember the days you struggled just to make a yo-yo spin, and if you were really fancy, to "walk the dog"? you ain't seen nothin 'yet. japanese yo-yo world champion black tells the inspiring story of finding his life's passion, and gives an awesome performance that will make you want to pull your yo-yo back out of the closet.
and 100 pages later.
now, what's this to do with memes?
so that's how the idea came about.
some, it's quite hard to tell why.
tool use must have enhanced our survival, mating and so on.
let's call them techno-memes or temes.
and on that basis, i've suggested a different kind of equation.
my cat gave birth to four kittens, purring all the time.
what's going to happen?
susan blackmore: memes and "temes"
this is the ministry of justice.
and every building that they build going forward will be safe.
and i would try to reason with them and say, "why don't we try something else?
and it also turns out that it would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain.
and how much punishment would i get if i get caught?
turns out the people who tried to recall the ten commandments -- and in our sample nobody could recall all of the ten commandments -- but those people who tried to recall the ten commandments, given the opportunity to cheat, did not cheat at all.
these things feel very differently.

bill lange: we tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep on average, and that we're real familiar with the animals that are in the first 200 or 300 feet, but we're not familiar with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom.
we make maps of these mountain ranges with sound, with sonar, and this is one of those mountain ranges.
bl: the white material is a type of bacteria that thrives at 180 degrees c.
and here's a male.
here's a tiny, little vent that's come out of the side of that pillar.
it's unbelievable. it's basically sulfuric acid, and it's being just dumped out, at incredible rates.
everything on this planet -- everything -- works by cycles and rhythms.
one is computation; this is the stuff you've forgotten.
in all seriousness. here's an example from a physics textbook.
so you get people arguing against each other, friend versus friend, in pairs, journaling, whatever.
how long will it take you to fill it up? and that's it.
we're no longer intimidated by math, because we're slowly redefining what math is.
now, the small hadron collider is in a cupboard, overlooked and neglected.
and if you go to these places, you meet people like this.
it was in places like this. this a school set up by some nuns in another slum called nakuru.
they know nothing about wikipedia.
one is to deliver extrinsic motivation, that education has a payoff.
so this is a school in a bus on a building site in pune, the fastest growing city in asia.
you should turn it into mcdonald's.
there are formal settings -- schools, colleges, hospitals -- in which innovation can take place, and informal settings -- communities, families, social networks.
so we are on the verge, 2015, of an amazing achievement, the schoolification of the world.

we're all trapped in these lines! these long lines trying to get on an airplane!
you may want to tell your spouse. who, if they're in love, might be gay as well.

that is the reason why i felt it was imperative that i presented you with this copy of the gay agenda.
look to your right.
this potential is not for the lucky few.
now let me say something about the staircase, which may seem like an odd metaphor for seniors given the fact that many seniors are challenged by stairs.
and so we can feel unfinished.
it turns out that cognitive research shows when we are able to do this, it manifests neurologically -- neural pathways are created in the brain.
they take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.
there are markings on many plants that look like other insects.
and under the scanning electron microscope, you can see the surface there -- really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at.

jonathan drori: the beautiful tricks of flowers
there was three years where i actually did have a real job, sort of.
so she's painting her little families.
i made another game called train.
our lives are being driven by data, and the presentation of that data is an opportunity for us to make some amazing interfaces that tell great stories.
i started taking a look as well at different perimeters, because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data.
there's actually a legless man that sits in that box and controls this chess player.
approximate collection rate of 11 sheep per hour, which would make a working wage of 69 cents per hour.

daisy bell: daisy, daisy... aaron koblin: and we took all of those individual pieces, and we fed them into another turk request.
so with everybody making so much amazing stuff and actually understanding what it was they were working on, i was really interested in trying to make a collaborative project where people were working together to build something.
and in a weird way, that's what i actually like about johnny cash's music as well.
so the project starts off by asking you to enter the address of the home where you grew up.

another functional work, it's in the south side of chicago for a subway station.
but more important is everybody has to make a story to make sense of the world.
the dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery.
along with that is a kind of spirit of equality. we're all basically equal.
and the other kind tells you how to cope with what we politely call "low self-esteem," or impolitely call "feeling very bad about yourself."
this idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to, i think it's a crazy idea, completely crazy.
they've slept with the wrong person. they've taken the wrong substance.
we are the first society to be living in a world where we don't worship anything other than ourselves.
so any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on, where the element of loss is.
now i am a firm believer in justice, i just think that it is impossible.
and so i starting thinking, not only am i not happy with the past, now i'm getting choked with, "i've only got 22 years left."
it's not that i didn't have help, but honestly, i sort of led, i was the team leader.
and it's odd, isn't it?
i don't know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm.
it was like an icu unit in the water.
and they have these long 30 to 40 to 50-ft. tentacles.

if you're an expectant parent, what about the ability to monitor, continuously, fetal heart rate, or intrauterine contractions, and not having to worry so much that things are fine as the pregnancy, and moving over into the time of delivery?
so, that's basically very simplistic technology of how this works.
well, i tried this device.
so, i did this thing for seven days getting ready for tedmed.
and the key thing was, what i didn't know, was that i was a really good dreamer.
one of the ones i just wanted to mention: the ishoe is another example of a sensor that improves proprioception among the elderly to prevent falling.
we can prevent, or have the earliest detection possible, for breast cancer with an ultrasound device given to the patient.
well, the single best way is to get them to understand that what they're being told is a whole lot of nonsense.
so in the second version of it, there are 100 billion or 1,000 billion people on earth, but they're all stored on hard disks or floppies, or whatever they have in the future.
or it might be that it's just 30 or 40, and i doubt that it's several hundred.
saying, not what are the situations, but what are the kinds of problems and what are the kinds of strategies, how do you learn them, how do you connect them up, how does a really creative person invent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and so forth.
in order to learn them, you have to go work in those restaurants.
so this is great for pickled vegetables, which is what we're canning here.
we used a red, very high-temperature silicon to do that.
here's a calculation that shows how the intensity of a barbecue, or other radiant heat source, goes as you move away from it.
that's what's happening to the water inside that popcorn.
you are a healer in a stone age village.
you had to have quite a flair for the dramatic, and be really, really quick.
surgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore; they had become gods.
so what you need to do, to take the capability of your hand, and put it on the other side of that small incision, is you need to put a wrist on that instrument.
and so it's perfect for something like that.
but it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us as we're going around.
but you care about nerves, if you are a surgical patient.
without biologist alexander fleming's moldy accident, caused by a neglected workstation, we wouldn't be able to fight off so many bacterial infections.
phthalates are additives used in everyday plastic products to increase their flexibility, durability and transparency.
jy: now that we grew the bacteria, we wanted to isolate strains by streaking onto mediate plates, because we thought that would be less accident-prone, but we were wrong again.
mw: i think our journey has truly transformed our view of microorganisms, and jeanny and i have shown that even mistakes can lead to discoveries.
in places it is cold.
and this is a model that they did of that seven-screen presentation.
so i've always liked this prototype picture.
charles used to say, "the extent to which you have a design style is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem."

they do it to make a profit.
but that doesn't make you a slave either.
now, gentlemen... brent, where is your money going this year?
slaves cost between 3,000 to 8,000 dollars in north america, but i could take you places in india or nepal where human beings can be acquired for five or 10 dollars.
well, first, before i even tell you the cost i've got to be absolutely clear.
we have made a commitment that we will never let people come out of slavery on our watch, and end up as second class citizens.
and the object that was levitating here is called a superconductor.
in this movie here, you can see how they flow one by one discretely.
but that's not the amazing part yet, because there is something i haven't told you yet.
but, of course, they don't look like rocks and sludge now.
when you study geology, you can see what's happened in the past, and there were terrific changes in the earth.
so my next thing: i was off to scotland to get mica.
and that was brought into force to try and deal with the mountain of stuff that is just being made and then living for a while in our homes and then going to landfill.
if i take 30 steps exponentially -- two, four, eight, 16 -- i get to a billion.
at least the exponential growth of information technology capability will continue unabated.
and halfway through the project, skeptics said, "well, this is not working out. you're halfway through the genome project and you've finished one percent of the project."
when i was a student it was across campus, now it's in our pockets.
and we invite you to participate. thank you very much.

they're able to guide their traffic with remarkable speed.
you think it's bad to lose one arm?
so, you won't see all the really cool stuff that's in this series elastic set of 14 actuators, each one which has its own capability to sense temperature and pressure.
it involved 17 different projects around the world.
and so what they found, in fact, is that exploitation really began heavily with the romans.
and that's exactly what the pilot did for me.
and so what that means is we can unambiguously identify which species are which even if they look similar to each other, but may be biologically quite different.
where do we find the most species of ocean life?
one of the things that we're taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive.
and what they found is that they think that we know of about nine percent of the species in the ocean.
on the scale of decades, in our lifetimes, we're going to see a lot of damage to coral reefs.
so what's a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses?
that's why we grow homes. thanks very much.
if you've got reflux oesophagitis, there are 15 procedures, and joe schmo does it one way and will blow does it another way, and none of them work, and that's the way it is with this word, hope.

we have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that, and that's what we'd like to know.
and the fundamental idea is you want to make inferences and then take actions.
but you know that your senses are not perfect, and therefore there's some variability of where it's going to land shown by that cloud of red, representing numbers between 0.5 and maybe 0.1.
imagine, as i shake the ketchup bottle, someone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me.

sixteen percent, by weight, of the interior contains frozen water, or ice.
there aren't many craters.
and that's a critical area of national security and economic vitality, to make sure we produce the next generation of scientists, engineers, mathematicians and technologists.
the airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time.
and let me conclude by saying not too far from here, right down the road in kittyhawk, north carolina, a little more than 100 years ago history was made when we had the first powered flight of an airplane on earth.
my daughter -- the day we got it, i was tucking her in -- and i said, "honey, you're my treasure."
and then some of the designs that people do they actually sell in the store.
let's see here.
two years ago, the ceo, lee scott, believed that green is the next big thing, and so wal-mart made going green a top priority.
and wal-mart has committed they're going to sell another 100 million light bulbs in the coming year. but it's not easy.
i think it's the most important legislation of 2006. why?
in fact, i'm afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough.
in 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies of the sort you see here. it doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars.
we've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome, the profitable outcome, and therefore the likely outcome.
so, i form friendships and co-worker and sibling and relative relationships with other people who in turn have similar relationships with other people.
and this holds for germs, ideas, product adoption, behaviors, and the like.
now, who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network?
if you pick this person, the only friend they have to nominate is this person, who, by construction, must have at least two and typically more friends.

another place i'd like to share with you is the zabbaleen in cairo.
but if it weren't for the strangely familiar stomach-churning odor that constantly passes through the apartment, it would be easy to forget that you are standing next to a cow shed and on top of a landfill.
so i'm scared we won't have enough robots.
on the left there is the packbot from irobot.
by the way, what's going on with the eyes?
these robots we're shipping every day.
and it's gone down slightly over the last 40 years.
let's fast-forward to the san francisco bay area many decades later, where i started a technology company that brought the world its first 3d laser scanning system.
these would be used for education, cultural tourism, etc.
let me close with another short story.
david.
the phones just aren't ringing about the people. "
now because it's student-driven, there's some amazing things that the movement has done.

stateless. the guy who tried to help the stateless people his whole career.
he started, as i mentioned, to get in the room with evil, to not denounce, and became almost obsequious when he won the nickname serbio, for instance, and even when he negotiated with the khmer rouge would black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room.
let's focus on what are the legitimate challenges and threats, but not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic, of a fear.
why should we care?
and it was at that moment that i just was filled with the challenge and the outrage that actually we know how to fix this problem.
but also the earning potential of these children is cut in half in their lifetime due to the stunting that happens in early years.
so i am convinced that if we can unlock the technologies that are commonplace in the richer world to be able to transform foods.
i'd like to talk about what i call our warehouses for hope.
they have to be nutritious, and they have to be locally produced.
now if we look at the economic imperative here, this isn't just about compassion.
and so, as a cancer doctor, you look at this, and you get a little bit downhearted.
i co-founded a company called navigenics, where, if you spit into a tube -- and we can look look at 35 or 40 genetic markers for disease, all of which are delayable in many of the cancers -- you start to identify what you could get, and then we can start to work to prevent them.
you will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic.
cancer is an interaction of a cell that no longer is under growth control with the environment.
earlier it was referred to this direct life device.
you change that system, and you could have a marked effect on the cancer.
we can start to see that system.
but they did that, and what they found is that 70 percent of the non-responders lived much longer and did better than people who got placebo.
so, just for two seconds, how these technologies work -- because i think it's important to understand it.
sorry about that. i've just given you a shot of cortisol, your fight / flight hormone.
the fourth way in which sound affects us is behaviorally.
let me just talk about brands for a moment, because some of you run brands. every brand is out there making sound right now.

young people in northern canada, kids in an elementary school, dragging sleds across the school-yard, pretending they were richard, ray and kevin. amazing.
and i hope, jill, that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet.
that's where all the assets are!
and as of just this week, last monday, google earth is now whole.
we're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system, and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife, all carbon-based units.
imagine what that means to our life support system.
the next 10 years may be the most important, and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life.
star trek made me want to see alien creatures, creatures from a far-distant world.
but attached to the base of the wing is a set of little, tiny control muscles that are not very powerful at all, but they're very fast, and they're able to reconfigure the hinge of the wing on a stroke-by-stroke basis, and this is what enables the fly to change its wing and generate the changes in aerodynamic forces which change its flight trajectory.
now, how many people here think the trump number is higher for the fruit fly?
this animal gets rid of them because they take up too much space.
here's a fly and a large infrared view of the fly in the flight simulator, and this is a game the flies love to play.
our mission is to build a detailed, realistic computer model of the human brain.
he's at home having tea.
if you zoom into the surface of the neocortex, you discover that it's made up of little modules, g5 processors, like in a computer.
how many of each type of tree do you have? where are they positioned?
we can look at the fabric. and we can change neurons.
we can load up all the neurons, each one on to its processor, and fire it up, and see what happens.
henry markram says the mysteries of the mind can be solved -- soon. mental illness, memory, perception: they're made of neurons and electric signals, and he plans to find them with a supercomputer that models all the brain's 100,000,000,000,000 synapses.
it would take 2,000 or 3,000 bombs.

author george dyson spins the story of project orion, a massive, nuclear-powered spacecraft that could have taken us to saturn in five years. his insider's perspective and a secret cache of documents bring an atomic age dream to life.
but the more interesting thing was that i started learning from people.
brown. thank you.
and these are different countries in europe. and you basically see two types of countries: countries on the right, that seem to be giving a lot; and countries on the left that seem to giving very little, or much less.

"what a piece of work is man! how noble in reason!"
and it's this importance why i decided to look into the issues that this technology has, because it's so fundamental to our lives.
you don't want to get close to gamma rays, it could be dangerous.
the one thing we need to do is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs, florescent lights, with this new technology of led, led light bulbs.
put your book beneath it and you can read.
and if you do the energy budget, the data transmission comes for free -- highly energy efficient.
and this light can be used to transmit wireless data that these things [use] to communicate with each other.
how's your genome today? have you thought about it lately?
look at this screen here and, you know, you see pictures and you see words, but really all there are are ones and zeros.
that's a tiny amount of material, but the way that ultimately expresses itself is what makes changes in humans and in all species.
we can understand, for example, why we create plaque in our arteries, what creates the starchiness inside of a grain, why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide.
they're not grown from seeds; they're grafted into root stock; they would not exist in nature on their own.
and then we understand what is terroir.
dogs have interests.
and they take this stuff seriously.
why aren't you responding? oh, you don't speak swahili.
so the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do, and this is very easy.

there is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse.
because through the cloud, through crowd sourcing, through the bottom-up world that we've created, where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate, we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation.

when we started thinking about this project -- how we would make a single diagnostic assay to screen for all pathogens simultaneously -- well, there's some problems with this idea.
if you've got enough money to buy just a camry, you can build one of these too, and so we put a deep how-to guide on the web, totally free, with basically order-off-the-shelf parts.
and kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus gives a nice signature down here.
day zero: nothing happening.
and the idea is that we simply have virtual patterns, because we're never going to get samples of every virus -- it would be virtually impossible. but we can get virtual patterns, and compare them to our observed result -- which is a very complex mixture -- and come up with some sort of score of how likely it is this is a rhinovirus or something.
you're looking at her open lung biopsy.
it doesn't make sense -- unless, maybe, there's a virus? "
that's where we're at.
the battery was invented about 200 years ago by a professor, alessandro volta, at the university of padua in italy.
it's about 50 feet wide and recedes about half a mile -- row after row of cells that, inside, resemble volta's battery, with three important differences.
it could be something like a wind farm.
and then it was onto the saucer.
and finally, human resources: conventional wisdom says hire battery experts, seasoned professionals, who can draw upon their vast experience and knowledge.
scientists use rovs to explore the oceans.
but the actual robot is really only half the story.
and then drake's equation, which is looking at the probability of life arising on planets, how long it might last, how many planets are out there, stuff like that.
but basically, this is the editor where we're going to design the next generation of our creature. so it has a little spine.
eventually they would go out into space, and start colonizing and exploring the universe.
so basically, i want the players to be able to experiment and explore a huge amount of failure space. so there goes one city.
so most people have no idea of the difference between like, an emission nebula and a planetary nebula.
we're going to come back to that in a few minutes, and i'm hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit, it could significantly change the way your life unfolds.
and what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance?
i notice a couple of things about this.
physiologically, there also are differences on two key hormones: testosterone, which is the dominance hormone, and cortisol, which is the stress hormone.
when you're in the low-power pose condition, only 60 percent, and that's a pretty whopping significant difference.
people hate this. it's what marianne lafrance calls "standing in social quicksand."
so i really struggled with this, and i have to say, having your identity taken from you, your core identity, and for me it was being smart, having that taken from you, there's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that.

t, see it's the same as f in music.
there i am like a bloody windmill again, you see.
now in this room with these four disabled musicians, within five minutes a rapt listening, a rapt response and some really insanely beautiful music.

have you all got a house? i'm going to ask you to live there for a few months, so make sure you've got it right.
housing for health projects aren't about measuring failure.
well, nine percent of what we spend is damage, misuse or abuse of any sort.
so how do we do that?
we were there originally to look at toilets and get human waste off the ground. that's fine.
it's man-made and can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings. "
i don't care if you call me a dyke. i really don't.
it actually sounds really hokey to say it standing up here, but when you try to put it in practice, it's really powerful.
but i'm the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet, so i get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm that i'm hoping to share with you all today.
and what do you know? we made 21st century money, and that was groundbreaking. wow!

well, the doctor can program a level of this st elevation voltage that will trigger an emergency alarm, vibration like your cell phone, but right by your clavicle bone.
it'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room when the thing goes off because, if you don't, you're in deep doo-doo.
and when you have a blockage, the alarm goes off and it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device, which gets your baseline electrogram from 24 hours ago and the one that caused the alarm, so you can take it to the emergency room and show them, and say, take care of me right away.
and finally he says, "ok, now i'm going to --" all of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse.

and so what i want to talk about today is trying to take these ideas that we've seen in the musical culture and try to bring these towards reinventing the way we think about writing books, using them and teaching from them.
what about copying, reusing, right?
audience: 65 dollars.
we came up with this six-and-a-half years ago because i teach the stuff in the red box.
if you have not, you must learn about it. creativecommons.org.
all of you here are tremendously imbued with tremendous amounts of knowledge and what i'd like to do is invite each and every one of you to contribute to this project and other projects of its type, because i think together we can truly change the landscape of education and educational publishing.
because some people think that the $100 laptop just happened a year ago, or two years ago, or we were struck by lightning -- this actually has gone back a long time, and in fact, back to the '60s.
scale is truly important.
none of those figure into our cost, because first of all, we sell it at cost, and the governments distribute it.
well, you can't see it.
set it up this way and it's a television set.
and that's very important, because so many things hit the market at a price and then drift up.
the only criticism, and people really don't want to criticize this, because it is a humanitarian effort; it is a nonprofit effort; and to criticize it is a little bit stupid, actually.
now there's a reason why i study this, versus traditional anthropology.

that means doctors and nurses simply don't have the time to take care of patients.
the door opens and there's a room full of mothers, mothers with babies, and they're sitting, and they're talking, they're listening.
our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained.
we can change national attitudes to women and national attitudes to hiv.
so we talk in terms of what we call task-shifting.
i started the program in capetown, south africa back in 2001.
so many labs around the world are involved in this kind of research, and we now have a really rich and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops, and this picture has radically changed the way we think about human brain development by revealing that it's not all over in early childhood, and instead, the brain continues to develop right throughout adolescence and into the '20s and' 30s.
this is the same set of shelves from his point of view.
so there's a famous quote by shakespeare from "the winter's tale" where he describes adolescence as follows: "i would there were no age between ten and three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the rest; for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting."
that's me behind the wheel, with my sister and my best friend at the time, and one day, he came home, when i was about 10 years old, and at the dinner table, he announced that for our next project, we were going to build a robot.
it was invited, after the first year, by the ars electronica museum in austria to have it installed in their lobby, and i'm happy to say it remained online there, 24 hours a day, for almost nine years.
we were totally surprised.
so here's an example. i'll use a figure eight, tracing out a figure eight as an example.
robots are the most human of our machines.
mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think, to create in himself the things he most wanted for south africa: peace, reconciliation, harmony.
when i started professionally guiding people out into this environment, solly was my tracker.

in fact, when he had his daughter many years later, he wanted to name her after mae west, but can you imagine an indian child name mae west?
now i'm in the business of creating art that will definitely even outlive me, and i think about what i want to leave behind through those paintings.
and i actually untagged myself first, then i picked up the phone. i said, "mom, you will never put a picture of me in a bikini ever again."
i said, "wow," again.
hello. my name is birke baehr, and i'm 11 years old.

he stopped, and he said, "yes, we would like to do that to deal with our overfishing problem, and i think we would call it a reverse fishing license."
it was over 32 degrees celsius for six months and it basically killed 60 percent of the coral.
and i'll leave you with one final slide, that is: how do we scale this up?
i did some quick calculations. i took the last 20 years of gdp growth and the last 20 years of labor productivity growth and used those in a fairly straightforward way to try to project how many jobs the economy was going to need to keep growing, and this is the line that i came up with.
and i will vouch that it handled the stop-and-go traffic on u.s. 101 very smoothly.
now, what we're in the middle of now is overcoming the limitations of our individual brains and infinitely multiplying our mental power.
our digital -- our technologies are great gifts, and we, right now, have the great good fortune to be living at a time when digital technology is flourishing, when it is broadening and deepening and becoming more profound all around the world.
what i did do, though is, i actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design.
under "nirvana" they showed this constable painting.
now, the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs.
i think that was -- the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good.
so it's: "trying to look good limits my life."
nevertheless, the treatment of the elderly varies enormously among traditional societies, from much worse to much better than in our modern societies.
in contrast, in traditional societies without writing, older people are the repositories of information.
that means that all those old people are more of a burden on the few young people, and that each old person has less individual value.
unlike other caregivers, grandparents don't quit their job because they found another job with higher pay looking after another baby.
their lives are usually socially much richer than our lives, although materially poorer.
these are clearly biblical archetypes, and the thinking behind that was to create positive, globally-resonating storylines that could be tied to the same things that other people were pulling mean messages out of because then the person that's using religion for the wrong purpose just becomes a bad man with a bad message.
after a while, his advisers complained.
but this is not about religion, it's not about proselytizing.
i said, "look at the eyes. they're your eyes."

last summer when we were in our home in new york, he was out in the yard playing in his playhouse. and i was in my office working, and he came in, "baba, i want you to come with me. i want my toy."
and the good news is there might be an easy solution to that, and that's using our eyes more.
and the recent financial crisis, how much of this diagram might that figure take up?
as you can see, there's a kind of odd, regular pattern in the data, twin peaks every year.
what rises twice a year, once in easter and then two weeks before christmas, has a mini peak every monday, and then flattens out over the summer?
i already knew how to design, but it wasn't like i was amazingly brilliant at it, but more like i was sensitive to the ideas of grids and space and alignment and typography.
and that whole thing -- it's two languages both working at the same time.
so if we do the same, we see a radically different picture.
it's a way of squeezing an enormous amount of information and understanding into a small space.
you're capable of holding conflicting viewpoints joyously when you can see them.
and then will come what they call the heart, the lush heart note.
this smells of cut grass. now, this is the skeleton of the molecule.
this actually is roughly, in man-years of work, 200,000 dollars roughly, if you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits.
so i went searching when i started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story.
now, i could do the dance of electron tunneling, but i've done a video instead, which is much more interesting. here's how it works.

in the imagination i saw the endless possibility of life, the endless truth, the permanent creation of reality, the place where anger was an expression in the search for love, a place where dysfunction is a true reaction to untruth.
and this is how we look for them.
you then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface.
he was very able to use stones effectively as tools.
we're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species, with a few nice things thrown in, perhaps.
we have a common past and we share a common future.
i had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my "creative projects" folder -- it's a repository for my brain, everything that i could possibly be interested in.
and actually, by the end of the day, i had a reasonable skull, a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis.
i'd bought a replica, a really crappy replica, of the maltese falcon on ebay, and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference.
and it's beautiful. and i can state with authority at this point in time, when i'd finished it, of all of the replicas out there -- and there is a few -- this is by far the most accurate representation of the original maltese falcon than anyone has sculpted. now the original one, i should tell you, is sculpted by a guy named fred sexton.
that's half the weight of my dog, huxley.
and then everything went black.
"come on. stay with me. we can do it. we can do it together."
i tried to grasp what she was saying.
i felt so incredibly grateful for my life.
i knew it would be challenging, but it was actually a blessing, because maria always smiled.
i said, "well, i have to get a friend to drive me out because i can't drive. sort of can't walk either.
and as i looked up, i realized that he was pointing towards the blue mountains where the journey had begun.
but then i knew for certain that although my body might be limited, it was my spirit that was unstoppable.
these -- this artificially induced consumerism -- i think it's atrocious.
it's a seductor, but i just feel in my bones that that's possible.
i have this special interest in things like this which blow my mind.
i'm also interested in growth patterns: the unbridled way that nature grows things so you're not restricted by form at all.
this is what exists in nature. observation now allows us to bring that natural process into the design process every day. that's what i do.
it's great to have companies in italy who support this way of dreaming.
i said, "you get into biopolymers." they looked straight through me.
it's a city car. you drive along. you get out.
this is a shot in the studio.
it's self-inspirational again. i mean, the rare times when i'm there, i do enjoy it. and i get lots of kids coming -- lots and lots of kids coming.
so, it's going to end.
so you turn on the camera, turn out the lights.
another thing all these molecules are telling us that, apparently, bioluminescence has evolved at least 40 times, maybe as many as 50 separate times in evolutionary history, which is a clear indication of how spectacularly important this trait is for survival.
so, she's got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mousetrap of needle-sharp teeth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey.
for this fish, it's actually whole cells with nuclei and membranes.
made an intensified camera, wanted to make this electronic jellyfish.
and based on this, i went back to the national science foundation and said, "this is what we will discover."
they're likely to tell you, "eight o'clock is too late for me, but that's okay, i can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight."
and then this happened.
that's a good thing, so i accepted the prize.
this is in montana, 2008.
and i thought, in the beginning -- i studied this bird for a couple of years -- that, well, shouldn't the brain of this bird be damaged?
so i've been hearing color all the time for eight years, since 2004, so i find it completely normal now to hear color all the time.
and also, some rachmaninov piano concertos as main dishes, and some bjork or madonna desserts, that would be a very exciting restaurant where you can actually eat songs.

i grew up in the south and whiled away the summers fishing.

it was characterized by a nation-versus-nation, very fragile standoff.
now, the bomb shelters at that point -- let's say you bought a prefab one -- it would be a few hundred dollars, maybe up to 500, if you got a fancy one.
chapter two starts in 1991.
and there's a lot of controversy about whether terror organizations have the know-how to actually make a nuclear weapon.
this is alexander lebed, who was a general that worked with yeltsin, who talked about, and presented to congress, this idea that the russians had developed -- these suitcase bombs. they were very low yield -- 0.1 to one kiloton, hiroshima was around 13 kilotons -- but enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage.
and if you're in the half-mile radius of where this bomb went off, you have a 90 percent chance of not making it.
they are paralyzed.
now, this is my favorite civil defense slide, and i -- -- i don't want to be indelicate, but this -- he's no longer in office. we don't really care, ok.
and rightly so, in many cases.
we can make progress. we can show benefits.
the question then is, how do we tap into this?
reducing pollution is expensive, therefore businesses don't want to do it.
in the very short run, you can sometimes fool yourself into thinking that there's fundamentally opposing goals, but in the long run, ultimately, we're learning in field after field that this is simply not true.
but we also have to recognize business is not going to do this as effectively as if we have ngos and government working in partnership with business.
i can cut any way i want to, so i cut right here.
but fortunately, our digital man has "undo."
so this is anatomage table. thank you.
much of this revolution can be traced to four men who met at cambridge university in 1812: charles babbage, john herschel, richard jones and william whewell.
the philosophical breakfast club changed that, working together.

it grows up into the adult stage like that and then goes through a benjamin button phase, and actually goes backwards and backwards until it's like a little embryo again, and then actually grows back up, and back down and back up -- sort of yo-yo -- and it never dies.
so i'm highlighting just a few words and saying definitions like that rely on things that are not based on amino acids or leaves or anything that we are used to, but in fact on processes only.
that's charles offria on the left, titus brown on the right.
because if we can, maybe we have a chance of actually discovering life somewhere else without being biased by things like amino acids. "
and here's the result.
i can tell you indeed it is, because this type of spectrum, just like what you've seen in books, and just like what you've seen in amino acids, it doesn't really matter how you change the environment, it's very robust; it's going to reflect the environment.
and that in a sense removes us again, like all of our scientific discoveries, or many of them -- it's this continuous dethroning of man -- of how we think we're special because we're alive.
we don't know -- and this is really amazing to me -- we don't know how many children were born, or how many children there are in bolivia or botswana or bhutan.
i can tell you, i often wasn't really paying attention.
and when i saw the palm pilot for the first time, i thought, why can't we put the forms on these palm pilots and go out into the field just carrying one palm pilot, which can hold the capacity of tens of thousands of paper forms? why don't we try to do that?
and this is a problem for which we need to scale this technology and we need to scale it now.
so we created software called magpi, which has an online form creator.
that's less than i used to get just traveling out for two weeks to do a consultation.
how do we steer a balloon?
this is very practical.
and then he asked me -- and this is something i will never forget in my life -- he just asked me, "you're the good pilot up there.
we landed with 40 kilos.
if we want to show the potential, we have to fly day and night.
this is the complete structure of the airplane.
so, through speeches like this one today, through interviews, through meetings, our goal is to get as many people possible on the team.
you can, it turns out, be in two places at once.
band aid, live aid.
six-and-a-half thousand africans dying every single day from aids -- a preventable, treatable disease -- for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy.
because there is no way we can look at what's happening in africa, and if we're honest, conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else.
"the war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty."
more anti-retrovirals make sense.
ideas that you gestated in your youth.
last year at data, this organization i helped set up, we launched a campaign to summon this spirit in the fight against aids and extreme poverty.
that's really what i would like you to do.
you see, if this is true, and i believe it is, that the digital world you all created has uncoupled the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter, this should be a piece of piss.
that's one billion media hits.
one, by one, by one.
thank you very much once again.
so, how do we make and understand metaphors?
third step is cognitive dissonance.

penelope jagessar chaffer: i was going to ask if there's a doctor in the house.
in fact, my involvement in the whole pesticide issue was sort of a surprise as well when i was approached by the largest chemical company in the world and they asked me if i would evaluate how atrazine affected amphibians, or my frogs.
p so speaking of estrogen, one of the other compounds that tyrone talks about in the film is something called bisphenol a, bpa, which has been in the news recently.
the evidence of that is that studies in rats, again with atrazine, show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion.
p it's a very profound notion to know that we as women are at the vanguard of this.
now if i told the men in this village that the frogs have pour immune function and eggs developing in their testes, the connection between environmental health and public health would be clear.

the retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals.
the record-holder, only two-and-a-half inches long, had 84 pieces in its tiny stomach.

to us, when we look at a redwood tree, it seems to be motionless and still, and yet redwoods are constantly in motion, moving upward into space, articulating themselves and filling redwood space over redwood time, over thousands of years.
all other primates, when they're scared, they run up a tree, where they feel safe.
and then the trees tend to flare out into platform-like areas at the top.
these are millennial structures -- portions of the tree that are believed to be more than 1,000 years old.
it made a trans-species jump out of some other organism in asia, where it was living on hemlock trees in asia.
so, you have to wonder when, you know, if some other species than us was recording the stories that mattered on earth, you know, our stories are about iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip.
all right.
so there is some sort of justice in the world after all.
and that's the last 20 minutes of malware every single day.
these guys were running an operation called i.m.u., a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions.
and that code has been encrypted, so let's decrypt it.
now that's a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in st. petersburg.
because everything around us is being run by these.
mikko hypponen: fighting viruses, defending the net
a lot of people are worried about what is rationality about?

i've taken inputs on positions and so forth, run it through a computer model that had simulated the dynamics of interaction, and these are the simulated dynamics, the predictions about the path of policy.
these folks are the moneyed interests in iran, the bankers, the oil people, the bazaaries.
so it would be a good thing.
and that's over 20 hours of video every minute.
the video's inspired over 26,000 dollars in donations to end domestic violence.
margaret gould stewart, youtube's head of user experience, talks about how the ubiquitous video site works with copyright holders and creators to foster a creative ecosystem where everybody wins.
we will not be there.
the palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance.
and i realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way.
or are you running the same pattern? because i believe that the invisible force of internal drive, activated, is the most important thing in the world.
that's "how do you take the invisible and make it visible," right?
somebody who's working for you, you know, or a partner, or even yourself. when you fail to achieve a goal, what's the reason people say they fail to achieve?
but i appreciated the energy, i'll tell you that.
what shapes you? two invisible forces. very quickly. one: state.
everyone needs certainty that they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable. now, how do you get it?
now, you can get significance a million ways, but to be significant, you've got to be unique and different.

that machine is, today, about as fast as my iphone.
now at this point, i would also like to emphasize that, with the greatest respect for the people that i'm now going to show -- i'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies -- so it's with great respect for the people that have died under violent circumstances that i'm showing these pictures to you.
so it really, really helps the criminal investigation to establish the cause of death, and in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction to find out who the killer really was.
so when i virtually touch data, it will generate forces in the pen, so i get a feedback.
so what we're really getting out of this is information of the structure of the brain, but we can also measure the difference in magnetic properties of blood that's oxygenated and blood that's depleted of oxygen.
so this is really, really nice, and i think this is a great tool.
my motto is always, i only hire people that are smarter than i am and most of these are smarter than i am.
i used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible, to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world.
so it's not the final story, but it's an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know about nature at the most basic level.
i won't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this, but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know.
as i pursued my career, something was always gnawing away inside me.
and in 2001, i took a research leave to visit them.
and so when word came out that aims was opening, it spread very quickly via e-mail and our website.
when a county is colored yellow, we've received an application; orange, we've accepted an application; and green, a student has graduated.
and after aims, shehu wanted to do high-energy physics, and he came to cambridge.
we want to roll out 15 aims centers in the next five years, all over africa.
accepting his 2008 prize, physicist neil turok speaks out for talented young africans starved of opportunity: by unlocking and nurturing the continent's creative potential, we can create a change in africa's future.
rory is a graduate student at stanford.
and nobody was listening then, but now people are beginning to listen because there's a pressing, technological problem that we face.
this is what intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip.
instead of doing this in software, or doing those kinds of algorithms, we went and talked to neurobiologists who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina.
this is a steel drum here that has been modified, and that's what happens when you put africa in a piano.
so, to begin with, we need to understand what a black hole is so we can understand the proof of a black hole.
it depends only on the mass of the object.
and there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy, just to give you a sense of scale.
and what we see is a line of stars.
so, to give you a sense of what this is like, it's actually like looking at a pebble at the bottom of a stream.
but it's the key to this experiment. the orbit tells me how much mass is inside a very small radius.
likewise, for the young stars, or in contrast, the young stars, they just should not be there.
so this is what we hope to do in the next few years.
but he was tough when it came to music.
it's so simple, so evocative.
now inspired moves of improvisation could be recorded, saved, considered, prioritized, made into intricate designs.
it's just these two notes in the middle.
and to me that's the most essential of all.
but now i'm excited that there's more chance than ever before possible of sharing this music.
then of course, at the dawn of aviation, all of the great inventors of the time -- like hargreaves, like langley, even alexander graham bell, inventor of the telephone, who was flying this kite -- were doing so in the pursuit of aviation.
so we're beyond the 12-second steps.
i'm really happy that mr. anderson invited me.
and another thing that i enjoy doing is drawing -- drawing, because i like to draw, you know, japanese anime art.
jl: one more.
he's doing tricks here, dance tricks, that probably no six-year-old in history ever managed before.
the bigger the crowd, the more potential innovators there are.
so, this possibility of a new type of global recognition, i think, is driving huge amounts of effort.
you know, we've heard that this week -- this romantic notion of the lone genius with the "eureka!" moment that changes the world is misleading.
suddenly, he starts to emulate and then to innovate.
reading and writing are actually relatively recent inventions.
tedtalks can't be a one-way process, one-to-many.
christopher makau: hi. my name is christopher makau.
if you go on the ted website, you can currently find there over a full week of tedtalk videos, over 1.3 million words of transcripts and millions of user ratings.
secondly, it's imperative that you do not cite the new york times.
i hope you enjoy designing your own ultimate and worst possible tedtalks.
cultures discovered the key feature of valuation thousands of years ago.
and i'm thinking i'm not seeing love and admiration on the left.
then you have to update your model based on the signals coming back, and you have to do something that is interesting, which is you have to do a kind of depth of thought assay.
but we're also studying just a small part of what makes us interesting as human beings, and so i would invite other people who are interested in this to ask us for the software, or even for guidance on how to move forward with that.
so, starting with the political philosophy.
and hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully. there we are.
we're going to make every contract -- we're announcing this today -- available on the internet so anyone can see what the terms are, what the conditions are, driving huge value for money, but also huge increases, i believe, in well-being as well.
that sort of behavioral economics can transform people's behavior in a way that all the bullying and all the information and all the badgering from a government cannot possibly achieve.
we all need people who will give us feedback.
so there's really only one area where we're near the top, and that's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills.
sarah brown wessling: good morning everybody.
[every classroom could look like that] bill gates: one day, we'd like every classroom in america to look something like that.
by the end of this year, we'll be able to sequence the three million bits of information in your genome in less than a day and for less than 1,000 euros.
let me take you on a little tour.
there were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion.
i could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science.
he was released, but then a day or two later, he was taken to the airport and he was deported.
now there are laws in many parts of the world which reflect the best of human nature.
hilma: i found out when i went to the hospital for a pregnancy check-up.
but for the first time in three decades into this epidemic we have a real chance to come to grips with hiv.
but changing the law isn't.
i thought i would start with a very brief history of cities.
and we should all care about this whether you live in cities or not.
this can also be a resilient electrical microgrid, community heating, power, communication networks, etc., can be concentrated there.
we can combine shared use and folding and autonomy and we get something like 28 times the land utilization with that kind of strategy.
parking's really expensive. it's about 70,000 dollars per space to build a conventional parking spot inside a building.
kent larson: brilliant designs to fit more people in every city
and sharks used to come into the bay.
or my favorite, "liabhan chor greine," the great fish of the sun.
and we tagged them very simply, not very hi-tech, with a big, long pole.
and here's one that we haven't ground-truthed it yet with sea surface temperature and water depth, but again, the second shark kind of spent most of its time in and around the irish sea.
so he did another study using microsatellites, which are much more expensive, much more time consuming, and, to his surprise, came up with almost identical results.
i don't know. i don't believe it.
so i tried that, i tried many techniques.
you can only rarely be in the right place to find sharks into august.
they're often quite brief. they're often very seasonally constrained.
i am an undercover journalist.
i am glad today the tanzanian government has taken action, but the key issue is that the tanzanian government could only take action because the evidence was available.
[i will curse anas to death] [anas lies] [alarm blows over anas' news for cash video] [agenda against top ceps officials exposed] [anas operates with invisible powers?] [gov't wobbles over anas video] [hunting the hunter] [anas' bribe 'men in court] [15 heads roll over anas tape] [finance minister backs anas] [11 given queries over anas' story] [gja stands by anas] [prez. mills storms tema harbour over anas video] ["late prof. john evans atta mills: former president of ghana"] john evans atta mills: what anas says is not something which is unknown to many of us, but please, those of you who are agents, and who are leading the customs officers into temptation, i'm telling you, ghana is not going to say any good things to you about this.
that is why i was particularly excited when we launched our "africa investigates" series where we investigated a lot of african countries.
human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other -- is that person dangerous? are they attractive?
it was an unorthodox upbringing, but as a kid on the streets of new york, you learn how to trust your own instincts, you learn how to go with your own ideas.
puberty had hit, and i had no idea what being a girl meant, and i was ready to figure out who i actually was.
and had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination?
the fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage.
it wasn't that we had too many boxes, it was that we had too few.
hopefully these categories, these binaries, these over-simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they'll begin to fall away.
good people could be seduced across that line, and under good and some rare circumstances, bad kids could recover with help, with reform, with rehabilitation.
"don't blame us. it's not the system. it's the few bad apples, the few rogue soldiers."
what was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution?
so my book, "the lucifer effect," recently published, is about, how do you understand how good people turn evil?
gets it right, reward him.
a dial in a sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient, down to the majority, down to none.
they put me in the car, then they drove me around palo alto.
do they change their appearance? 15.
so another report, an investigative report by general fay, says the system is guilty. and in this report, he says it was the environment that created abu ghraib, by leadership failures that contributed to the occurrence of such abuse, and the fact that it remained undiscovered by higher authorities for a long period of time.
he was the one that stopped those abuses you saw, because when he saw those images, he turned them over to a senior investigating officer.
he's standing on a subway in new york.
thanks so much.
but at any rate, they are there.
and depending on how you create the pattern of lighting or not lighting, the digital elements, or, for that matter, the neurons in the sheet, you're going to be able to construct a map.
so think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy the brain is.
so for example, i'm making images of you, but there's no physiological bond between the images i have of you as an audience and my brain.
but look at the arrows.
and this is, of course, the culture where we have developed something that i like to call socio-cultural regulation.
at this ripe old age of 30, i've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up in this horrible, beautiful time, and i've decided, for me, it's been a real journey and paradox.
my mom says, "patriarchy."
thank you.
i wrote about nia martin-robinson, the daughter of detroit and two civil rights activists, who's dedicating her life to environmental justice.
my mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory, or certainty, or security even.
and we can barely find the time to reflect deeply back in on our own selves.
the green and red bars show that same signal displayed by frequency, with lower frequencies here and higher frequencies up here.
over 17 days at the olympics 7,000 visitors from all over the world actually got to individually control the light from the c.n. tower, parliament and niagara in real time with their minds from across the country, 3,000 km away.
the more you focus, the faster the rotation.
imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight.
the next, it was alive with her colorful ideas and expressions.
and he turned to my mother, and he said, "you haven't told her yet?"
but more significantly, they gave me the ability to believe, totally, to believe that i could.
and two years in, i really could see very little.
god no, it was therapy.
i always run it perfectly fine.
and then the minute it came, it blew up in my head and bashed in my heart -- something different.
do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we're not?
and i have learned, you know what, cars and motorbikes and elephants, that's not freedom.
what we have is exactly the same thing, the same activity, but one of them makes you feel great and the other one, with just a small change of posture, makes you feel terrible.
but i think there's another debate to be asked, which is the level of control we have over our tax money.
six million pounds spent to reduce the journey time between paris and london by about 40 minutes.
this is all i'm asking for really in human decision making, is the consideration of these three things.
quite often queues happen at the tolls.
i think they're right.
the effort to do that almost broke the organization.
this is the exact moment that i started creating something called tinkering school.
and the things that they build amaze even themselves.
but it doesn't just happen in the very dry world of preclinical basic science cancer research.
so here is one example of how you approach it.
this is a drug called tamiflu. tamiflu is a drug which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on stockpiling, and we've stockpiled tamiflu in panic, in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza.
it's a great honor today to share with you the digital universe, which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe.
coming in closer, picking up earth, orbit of the moon, and we see the earth.
for the last 12 years, carter emmart has been coordinating the efforts of scientists, artists and programmers to build a complete 3d visualization of our known universe. he demos this stunning tour and explains how it's being shared with facilities around the world.
music can change your life, more than almost anything.
the third idea i want to share with you is that music, paradoxically, i think even more than words, is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are. i love giving talks, although strangely i feel more nervous giving talks than playing music.
so instead of being grand opera, this opera will turn into what we're thinking of as personal opera.
but, then was the really interesting aspect of the work, following the engineering part, where, basically, we're coding over dan's shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out, you know, how does dan move?
so, in hearing this piece, as i mentioned before, the most important thing is the music's great, and it'll show you who dan is.
and then odysseus says, "i see that you can get it.
if you set goals for yourself and you're like a lot of other people, you probably realize it's not that your goals are physically impossible that's keeping you from achieving them, it's that you lack the self-discipline to stick to them.
but then i thought, oh, i'm sending myself mixed messages.
and this is a timely issue.
when you make an investment, what you're really saying is, "i accept that any one of these 100 things could happen to me and determine my wealth."
so this is one of our experiments.
and that's something that's easy to forget.
al-jebr finally came into english as algebra.
why is' x 'the symbol for an unknown? in this short and funny talk, terry moore gives the surprising answer.
but perhaps most heartbreaking of all are the stories of the abuse of even the most basic human rights, such as the young woman shown in this image here that are played out every day, sadly, even in the very institutions that were built to care for people with mental illnesses, the mental hospitals.
the first is that we need to simplify the message that we're using, stripping away all the jargon that medicine has invented around itself.
they asked themselves a question: if economics could make such a convincing case for early action on climate change, well why can't the same be done for conservation?
and unless we address this invisibility, we are going to get the results that we are seeing, which is a gradual degradation and loss of this valuable natural asset.
how bad can things get?
if you look at the lens of public wealth as against the lens of private profits, you get a completely different answer, which is clearly conservation makes more sense, and not destruction.
but calculating this at the next level, that means at the business sector level, is important.
and i'm delighted that the institute of chartered accountants in the u.k.
well i'm afraid not.
i also had the good fortune to be in those lectures, up in the balcony.
they took him -- i think it was for his birthday -- they took him for lunch.
can you build a machine that thinks like a human being, that is conscious?
i think the only point of similarity between us is we both like to talk about ourselves.
being dick, he, of course, wanted to check this.
and it sort of worked, but it didn't work very well.
this was more or less known.
this was the key to analyzing these experiments.
we took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing.
this brings us up to the time that i started consulting to airstream.
so, you know, we live in a world that's subjected to ever more stringent child safety regulations.
number two -- own a pocketknife.
take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school and we'll take it apart with them.
i think that's it. that's number five and a half. ok.
and then for that unstable ligament, we put in a human donor ligament to stabilize the knee.
it's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it, and then we can put it back into a patient's knee.
arthritis and injury grind down millions of joints, but few get the best remedy -- real biological tissue. kevin stone shows a treatment that could sidestep the high costs and donor shortfall of human-to-human transplants with a novel use of animal tissue.
it turns out that in the 1450s, the catholic church needed money, and so they actually hand-wrote these things called indulgences, which were forgiveness's on pieces of paper.
everybody should have one, ok?
and it's rare, because we never really get to see a brain.
golly, i'm just totally losing it.
now, you're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you.
for instance, like, when you're on an airplane, they show the movie, you get to watch it for free; when you want to hear the sound, you pay.
well, if i turn up the amplitude too much, i'm having an effect on the pressure, which means during the making of that sine wave, the speed at which it is propagating is shifting.
i'm serious. and they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance, and see a fraction of a degree kelvin in temperature shift from 100 yards away when they play this thing.
i'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet.
i became bizarrely popular.
and as you can see, it's extremely difficult to read.
so i'm using my own writings as a kind of testing ground for a book that has an interdependency between word and image as a kind of seductive force.
i had this idea that i wanted people to receive a kind of mysterious love letter, like a found fragment in their mailbox.
working in the commercial world, this is something that i do have to struggle with at times.
instead of wheels, a ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball.
this works with a laser sensor that's mounted on top of rezero.
part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure, but they're formed at the nanoscale.
and so that's what i would like be able to do -- convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table.
what if he says, 'oh, i already have one,' or, 'i've already memorized it'? "
now this is a high-powered battery that we grew in my lab.
we've been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them -- and use as a way of getting electrons through the device.
typically you get three different kinds of answers.
i sat at my desk. i used my expensive computer.
so you have to go back a few phases and start again.
you decide when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk.
but what's even worse is the thing that managers do most of all, which is call meetings.
you can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes or 45 minutes or an hour.
and if you try that, i think you'll find that you agree.
so thanks for listening.
i go in their homes. and we do this worldwide, and we follow them around town with video cameras.
but actually, you can do this kind of stuff with pcs.
and from a design perspective, it's about understanding what you can delegate to technology and what you can delegate to other people.
so, in your village, there's one person in the village with a phone, and that's the phone kiosk operator.
you can subscribe to these.
and then i go to this picture here, which is the one that i started with.
with another three billion people connected, they want to be part of the conversation.
or what we call the "sweet gravy, stop me before i kill again!"
when you eat healthier, manage stress, exercise and love more, your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen.
now we're also about to publish a study -- the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer.
i made a lot of mistakes and dumb decisions, of course.
and in fact, the more we have of either of these things -- the more agency and the more imagination with respect to a given regret, the more acute that regret will be.
but it turns out, when you look overall at what people regret in life, you know what, our financial decisions don't even rank.
and we certainly don't have any empathy for that part -- which explains the third consistent component of regret, which is an intense desire to punish ourselves.
but first i want to say that the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about.
it connects the poles of our lives back together, the positive and the negative, and it sends a little current of life back into us.
and ironically, i think it's probably the single most important thing i possibly could have tattooed onto my body -- partly as a writer, but also just as a human being.
in other words, they thought their differences were more important than their common humanity.
the market was so terribly disorganized that they were buying this medicine through two agents who were gigging them sevenfold.
we need a movie on those six categories.
so i rang up, asked paul farmer if he would help.
and not a single soul in this area was being treated for aids or tuberculosis.
it has been an honor for me, particularly, to work in rwanda where we also have a major economic development project in partnership with sir tom hunter, the scottish philanthropist, where last year we, using the same thing with aids drugs, cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percent and achieved three- to four-hundred percent increases in crop yields with the farmers.
it's a tiny, little island -- 60 miles by 90 miles.
and these kids know that painless climate control may not be part of their future.
there's an amazing river traveling through it, and you can see there how we manage to get across the river.
landscaping.
we've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives, and we said, okay, local, what does "local" mean?
so we built big models.
for several days now, we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at ted.
and before i left the hospital, after a year of being hospitalized, i had seven ruptures of my carotid artery.
even then, i'm aware that most people have little patience for my speaking difficulties.
when i read something, it will read in my voice.
in cosmological terms, that was about 10 minutes ago.
does anybody remember that? "
ironic that my legs are fine, and it's my shoulders that slow up my walk.
i seem, for the time being, to be cancer-free.
so, should we rather ask, "can anything save newspapers?"
my approach was very egotistic.
but the real hit was in bulgaria.
and everybody can do it.
so bear with me as i take you through this journey.
i was 64 lbs.
i was bald.
you learn things unconsciously.
and i was able to return to college because of the senior citizens who invested in me, and also the guide dog and skill set i had gained.
a peasant, who was walking to market that morning, ran towards where the gunshot had come from, and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor, clearly shot by a dueling wound.
i've taken two pictures here and i've made them artificially symmetrical.
and he said, "no, no, no. it was a very deliberate act."
what can you do to something? you close your eyes.
it seems mad to talk about nothing.
so what if i do b, which is a sixth of a turn, followed by c, which is a third of a turn?
it's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry.
and it turns out they almost did.
if you all stay down he wins it automatically.
and if you'd like your own symmetrical object, i have a project raising money for a charity in guatemala, where i will stay up all night and devise an object for you, for a donation to this charity to help kids get into education in guatemala.
the skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were grinding grain morning, noon and night.
thomas edison would have been very, very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today.
penicillin was discovered in 1928, but even by 1940, no commercially and medically useful quantities of it were being produced.
and nobody knows just why this was so, but one story can reflect something of it.
they might have been able to do it earlier.
you make the text larger with each tap.
double click the word. watch 200. i go double click.
and ok, so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable mac, you know, but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last, you know, 30 years.
or if you want to be destructive, you can just crumple it up and, you know, toss it to the corner.
when i was just about to give everything up after years of suffering, i started to rediscover the true power of music.
the photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there.
that's good.
nobody had any control over what was actually happening.
pragmatic chaos is, like all of netflix algorithms, trying to do the same thing.
and it uses what's called a bin-packing algorithm.
and that's going to keep happening.
kevin slavin argues that we're living in a world designed for -- and increasingly controlled by -- algorithms. in this riveting talk from tedglobal, he shows how these complex computer programs determine: espionage tactics, stock prices, movie scripts, and architecture. and he warns that we are writing code we can't understand, with implications we can't control.
shake -- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.
and remember, one towel per person for one year -- 571,230,000 pounds of paper. no small thing.
so, here's one. there's another one which i studied.
that means that if there are five cars waiting, you have to wait till they all go, then you go. it lacks the notion of alternating, or taking turns, and it's always on the minor road, allowing the major one to have primacy.
any tough problem, i think it can be solved.
so it was everywhere.
and bed nets are a great tool.
we need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things.
over 30 percent of kids never finish high school.
we should retain those people.
you might say, "do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave?"
well, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are.
it gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.
i love raku because it allows me to play with the elements.

the main part of it is the blue part, polycation, and it's basically very sticky to every tissue in your body.
there's actually normal muscle on top of it. see that?
well with our technology, the surgeon is able to tell immediately which nodes have cancer.
so there's that teamwork thing again.
i have patients who would benefit from this.
now the brain may not look like much from the outside -- a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh, amorphous -- but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain, and to see the intricacy of what lies within.
now before i tell you about the technology, the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room, if we live long enough, will encounter, perhaps, a brain disorder.
so how do we do this?
so for example, lets sort of consider that basket cell i told you about earlier -- the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory.
it's called pavlovian fear conditioning -- where a tone ends with a brief shock.
let's give an example of where we think this is going to go.
now how could you repair this?
to close, i want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology.
and they are brought inside by humans and other creatures.
why does this matter?
and then about two days later, the wind started to change a little bit, and you could sense that the air was not healthy.
the question that i found myself asking to people when i was talking about the book afterwards is -- when you've talked about emergent behavior, when you've talked about collective intelligence, the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that is to ask, who builds a neighborhood?
and, you know, i mean, i'll look at a couple of things like this, but google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing.
and there are all these interesting tools.
so gary bauer is not too far behind -- has slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection.
so 20 percent of the blogs get 80 percent of the links.
from mother to daughter, preacher to congregant, teacher to pupil, storyteller to audience.
in groups as large as 150 and as small as three, these young people discovered new places, new thoughts, new perspectives.
"to sir, with love" ignited its teen audience.
i was past 40 when my father died.
they are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed.
henry james would be proud.
there is an infinite game, and we're playing in that infinite game.
this is a hospital monitor from los angeles, sent to china.
i guess he didn't read vitruvius.
it means the way olympic athletes train with each other.
so designers all over the world can analyze their products down to the parts per million for human and ecological health.
and we now have 350-pound auto workers learning bird songs on the internet.
we lay out the building areas.
and these are examples of the kinds of programs u.s. intelligence agencies are running right now, against the whole rest of the world.
if the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer, or they're trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting, and they have leads and they have suspects, then it's perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect's phone, and to intercept his internet communications.
one way is to sabotage encryption algorithms, which is a great example about how u.s. intelligence agencies are running loose.
they even use cheesy powerpoint clip art like, you know, "success," when they gain access to services like this.

when conditions are right, we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural africa, just like anywhere else.
we're not trying to cut and paste the chicago model or the india model, but creating a system uniquely tailored to ethiopia's needs and realities, ethiopia's small farmers.
it will stop them from doing simple, back-to-back, limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from [surplus regions] to [deficit areas].
now, as architects we're trained to solve problems.
and it's one that gets very little attention.
a fantastic project, the initial plan called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted right across the african continent, from mauritania in the west, all the way to djibouti in the east.
he managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes.
it's a natural process. it goes on in nature today, and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them.
we call this the global village construction set.
if we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing, then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential.
they don't have a bucket or a box.
you'll have heard of cholera, but we don't hear about diarrhea.
so if you met an educationalist and said, "i can improve education attendance rates by 25 percent with just one simple thing," you'd make a lot of friends in education.
they've found in many developing countries that governments have gone in and given out free latrines and gone back a few years later and found that they've got lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms with their owners happily walking past them and going over to the open defecating ground.
somehow, people who'd been thinking that what they were doing was not disgusting at all suddenly thought, "oops."
i'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon and just ask you to do one thing, and that's to go out, protest, speak about the unspeakable, and talk shit.
and we predicted what would happen, and we got it all wrong.
and the average size trophy fish weighed 250 to 300 pounds, goliath grouper, and if you wanted to go out and kill something, you could pretty much count on being able to catch one of those fish.
it's very pretty, and it has rapidly started to overgrow the once very rich biodiversity of the northwestern mediterranean.
a friend and i did this thing in hollywood we called hollywood ocean night, and i was trying to figure out how to explain to actors what's going on.
the corals say, "you cheated. you didn't pay your rent."
so the question is: how are we all going to respond to this?
although, i might argue that, technically, every pile is atomic.
and that's when it happened.
"kew, kew, kew -- watch out."
i did not know what to say. i said, "yes."
and it was so successful that they made it into a movie.
now, faro is a bustling little city, and to get to the beach, she explained, you would have to take a bus and then a boat.
one of them was named joseph, and he asked me what was i doing, and i explained.
and recession, of course, isn't exactly a recipe for hope either, as we're busy finding out.
so it looks a little bit like this.
it was above the gdp for three years in a row just before the crisis.
and my, then, five year-old daughter was helping me in the way that five year-olds do.
so here, all of a sudden, we're looking at a map of the human heart.
only now, investment isn't going to be about the relentless and mindless pursuit of consumption growth.
so this is not about standing in the way of development.
tj: i would still want to know that you could do that and get below zero by the end of the century, in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere, and solve the problem of biodiversity and reduce the impact on land use and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water.
i also wanted to paint the highlights and create a mapping on his body in greyscale.
we got a pool. we filled it with milk.
i highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday, because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture on the geopolitics of oil again.
and every single oil is different when it hits water.
we don't want to be buying oil; we want to be doing something green.
there were no lips.
and we have this kind of -- as voters, we have kind of a "eureka!" moment.
we put it in. there was a tremendous banditry problem.
so, what i'm going to talk to you about now is: what do we have to do this time?
now supposedly, oil taxes are the third rail of american politics -- the no-fly zone.
but you might not recognize aydah al jahani, who is a contestant, indeed a finalist, in the poet of the millions competition, which is broadcast out of abu dhabi, and seen throughout the arab world.
aydah al jahnani also took risks and put herself out, to compete in the poet of the millions competition.
and while that swim took place three years ago, i can remember it as if it was yesterday.
so it's right up in the heavens.
it is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have.
when i was born, the world's population was 3.5 billion people.
it is so much stranger than you think.
this is a silicon wafer, and essentially that's just a whole bunch of layers of two-dimensional stuff, sort of layered up.
he did a lot of this work in the '60s, and so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow as we went down the digital computer revolution, but it's now coming back.
with the universe as a computer, you can look at this droplet of water as having performed the computations.
so this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope.
so maybe i'll do that with this short video.
we will be an overwhelmingly urban species.
and this is a huge, huge energy savings, because what comes out of our tailpipe is really just the beginning of the story with climate emissions from cars.
and while we could try and figure out new ways to use those capacities -- such as cooking or making ice sculptures or even a mafia hit -- what we probably will find is that, in fact, turning those products into services that we have access to when we want them, is a far smarter way to go.
i would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible, they're being done right now, and that it's a darn good thing.
for example, any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture were routine forms of criminal punishment. the kind of infraction today that would give you a fine, in those days would result in your tongue being cut out, your ears being cut off, you being blinded, a hand being chopped off and so on.
now, each one of them is thinking, "i don't really want to kill that guy, but he's about to kill me.
i loved that talk. i think a lot of people here in the room would say that that expansion of -- that you were talking about, that peter singer talks about, is also driven by, just by technology, by greater visibility of the other, and the sense that the world is therefore getting smaller. i mean, is that also a grain of truth?
it's not surprising, because only three percent of people in the drc use condoms.
hiv is a serious problem in the dr congo, and aid agencies have flooded the country with free and cheap condoms. but few people are using them. why? "reformed marketer" amy lockwood offers a surprising answer that upends a traditional model of philanthropy.
and we had one set of countries up there which was the western world.
and when i now finally got it right, i can go back 200 years in history.
whereas when my oldest son, who works for google, he should develop by quarter, or by half-year.
this is east asia, and the light blue there is south asia.
and i can split the others. here is the south asian, arab world.
and that doesn't come easy from the mouth of a swedish public health professor.
and they reduced child mortality, with an amazing 4.7 percent per year. they beat sweden.
not simplistic extrapolation.
look at the provinces of kenya. they are very different.
and we have to have more concepts than just developing countries and developing world.
because what happened in the beginning, this stuff encases itself in a cell, then cells start hanging out together in societies.
does kind of convey the sense that this is an integrated system.
we have this non-zero-sum relationship, and i think that does lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that you realize that someone else's welfare is positively correlated with yours -- you're more likely to cut them a break.
i think we're going to have to have a major round of moral progress in the world.
to really understand it, you've got to say, "oh, i get it.
author robert wright explains "non-zero-sumness" -- the network of linked fortunes and cooperation that has guided our evolution to this point -- and how we can use it to help save humanity today.
it appeals to pity. it appeals to something called charity.
support research institutions, because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation.
how do we begin to do that, and why is aid the bad instrument?
the imf, the world bank, and the cartel of good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as citizens, and therefore what our governments are doing, because they depend on aid, is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens.
the military, 380 billion.
and she said, "but this is cnn, so you only get a sound bite."
and now, 14 of the disorders are treatable, two of them actually curable.
it should be interested in the best things in life.
but the upshot of this is that the mission i want psychology to have, in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill, and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable, is can psychology actually make people happier?
len is an introvert.
now obviously she failed.
and what happens is when we test people one week later, a month later, three months later, they're both happier and less depressed.
so, chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard, and so this was amazing for me. i've never been in a gathering like this.
oh, the wrath of photoshop.
i can see the rocks are over here.
the original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species, of an exotic locale.
this is actually one of the rangers.
but here, brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard.
they have been rarely photographed, partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean.
which just resulted in a fantastic photograph.
if we zoom in on this photograph right here, we can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her, because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time to get a nice image of her facial texture.
but they basically created a digital puppet of her, where you can pull on these various strings, and it actually moves her face in ways that are completely consistent with the scans that we took.
computer graphics trailblazer paul debevec explains the scene-stealing technology behind digital emily, a digitally constructed human face so realistic it stands up to multiple takes. & lt; em & gt; & lt; / em & gt;
it's where i really getting passion with what i'm doing right up to now -- i'm standing in front of you -- doing botany and wildlife conservation.
on their way, they looted everything.
and this is a bright guy, hard-working person, and pygmy.
we heard that now from the east again the war started, and it's going fast.
sometimes, they are having a helicopter to supply them with ammunition and so on.
during the first two rebellions, they killed all animals in the zoo.
i don't know where to start, where to finish it.
if i know when i was young, that [by] killing an elephant, i'm destroying biodiversity, i would not have done it.
and this isn't only happening in amusement parks.
i'd like to take an example of a controversial use of a market mechanism, a cash incentive, and see what you think about it.
hm: well, the intrinsic motivation should be to learn.
if you sell me a flat screen television or give me one as a gift, it will be the same good.
in the past three decades, says michael sandel, the us has drifted from a market economy to a market society; it's fair to say that an american's experience of shared civic life depends on how much money they have. in a talk and audience discussion, sandel asks us to think honestly on this question: in our current democracy, is too much for sale?
but you know what the actual facts are?
we have in higher education a trillion dollars of student debt, and our college completion rate is 15 points, 15 percentage points below canada.
and then we had the electric washing machine.
we went from 25 percent urban to 75 percent by the early postwar years.
and i'm gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within, and to follow the ted commandments: that is, actually, something that creates a near-death experience, but near-death is good for creativity.
that figure right there, by the way, figure right there was a toy given to me when i was but nine years old, and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age.
and you see, there's a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen, trying to figure it out -- years and years, oftentimes.
and that means because we went into iraq, we should stay there until things were solved. you know, maybe even 100 years.
and it seems like it's happening all the time.
my mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book, because it seemed i knew things i was not supposed to know.
and he said, "well, i guess with everything in life, there's a place of balance."
now you, as westerners, and i, as westerners, would say well, that's superstition. but after being there for a while, and seeing the amazing things that happened, you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world, determining how things happen.
novelist amy tan digs deep into the creative process, looking for hints of how hers evolved.
and that model of, and we heard it yesterday, if we could only get onto the homepage of google, if we could only figure out how to get promoted there, if we could only figure out how to grab that person by the throat, and tell them about what we want to do.
now, this is copernicus, and he was right, when he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea.
two of the big success stories of the last 20 years in retail -- one sells things that are super-expensive in a blue box, and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them.
these are the people who are obsessed with something.
every one made a profit. how?
number two: the riskiest thing you can do now is be safe.
but they do have a lake.
so i'll be sharing some of these noes with you.
i used to be a malthusian.
but i think we're in for another change, about two generations after the top of that curve, once the effects of a declining population start to settle in.
and because i'm an underwater photographer, i wanted to do this story from both above and below, to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups making its very first swim in the icy 29-degree water.
these are the lions and tigers of the sea.
this ended up being the lead picture in the global fishery story in national geographic.
this is a very sort of un-shark-like photograph.
we have the southern right whale that we see here and the north atlantic right whale that we see here with a mom and calf off the coast of florida.
and i really wanted this story to be about three things: i wanted it to be about abundance, about diversity and about resilience.
there was a very sick orangutan baby, my first encounter.
as you can see there's only yellow terrain.
only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary.
this is an area of about 50 million hectares.
and you can create so much energy from this -- they produce three times more energy per hectare per year, because you can tap them on a daily basis.
can you imagine?
and biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced, how many medicines can be kept here.
all the seeds get eaten.
willie smits: how to restore a rainforest
a pair of helices and 40 wooden slats.
i like working with my hands.
the best example of quality of life is the turtle because the turtle is an example of living and working together.
and one thing: it's important not for only your own city; every city, besides its normal problems, they have a very important role in being with the whole humanity.
so, when the only woman in your life is your mother-in-law, you have a problem.
and every part can be transformed; every frog can be transformed in a prince.
the second reason is that when people do get interested in it, as i think they should, they tend to say the most appalling things.
one: consciousness does not exist.
now, that's the common-sense definition. that's our target.
there's something that it feels like to drink beer which is not what it feels like to do your income tax or listen to music, and this qualitative feel automatically generates a third feature, namely, conscious states are by definition subjective in the sense that they only exist as experienced by some human or animal subject, some self that experiences them.
now, we know that that's wrong.
so the objection that you can't have an objective science of consciousness because it's subjective and science is objective, that's a pun.
... don't you feel?
but i also meet people who love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else.
we don't teach american history in britain.
teenagers do not wear wristwatches.
maybe they go later, not right away.
no, it doesn't.
i could not get this thing to work no matter how often or how hard i blew into it.
these technologies, combined with the extraordinary talents of teachers, provide an opportunity to revolutionize education.
that's a powerful historical force.
but it doesn't sound so much, it's not relatively enough, it won't make a difference if you've already committed 100,000 soldiers previously.
and she said, "what on earth for?"
that means i need to know how i tick, when i collapse, where my formidable points are, where my weaker points are.
how can the child feel stronger?
this century there's a shift.
in the moment, that's what he did.
scilla elworthy: fighting with non-violence
this is a dry lake bed.
this is a work called "learning to see."
there's a slot for the mouth. it's two and a half inches thick, concrete with a void interior.
as an industrial engineer, cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur.
paul and anne ehrlich's environmental impact equation: i is equal to p times a times t: population, affluence and technology.
renewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total, and growing rapidly.
costs, products, people, marketplaces -- what else is there?
hawken fulfilled business and industry, leading humankind away from the abyss because, with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere, a very dear person is at risk here -- frankly, an unacceptable risk.
ray anderson: the business logic of sustainability
saddled in the performing arts as we are, by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming, locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the 19th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues, where we charge exorbitant prices.
you see them on youtube, in dance competitions, film festivals and more.
i promise you the hand of the doris duke charitable foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come.
i've learned through experience that people remember pictures long after they've forgotten words, and so i hope you'll remember some of the pictures i'm going to share with you for just a few minutes.
i went out and hired a student of frank lloyd wright, the architect, and i asked him to build me a world class center in the worst neighborhood in pittsburgh.
we even have flowers in the hallway, and they're not plastic.
and we've never looked back.
what we've discovered is you have to give them flowers and sunlight and food and expectations and herbie's music, and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time.
in fact, i brought in a mosaic artist from the vatican, an african-american woman who had studied the old vatican mosaic techniques, and let me show you what they did with the work.
you have to change the way that people see themselves before you can change their behavior.
i said, "you're the gift."
and that was our first recording studio, which was the broom closet.
and we got the funding and we open in the fall.
i said, "any chance you know willie brown?"
and she turned that audience around on a pin.
and i don't think i'm crazy.
like this pattern of pulses here actually means "baby's face," and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses, it knows that what was out there was a baby's face, and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was, say, a dog, or another pattern would be a house.
now just to orient you, each box is showing the firing patterns of several cells, and just as in the previous slides, each row is a different cell, and i just made the pulses a little bit smaller and thinner so i could show you a long stretch of data.
sheila nirenberg: a prosthetic eye to treat blindness
and so, the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do, or all the bad things that bacteria do.
what you are looking at is the hawaiian bobtail squid, and it's been turned on its back, and what i hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these house the vibrio fischeri cells, they live in there, at high cell number that molecule is there, and they're making light.
we have a fancy name for this: we call it quorum sensing.
anywhere on your body, it looks pretty much like this, and what i hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there.
they either pop the bacterial membrane, they make the bacterium so it can't replicate its dna.
what happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors, and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals.
i keep getting older and older and they're always the same age, and it's just a crazy delightful job.
who should get the best flute?
he says that to reason about just distribution of a thing, we have to reason about, and sometimes argue about, the purpose of the thing, or the social activity -- in this case, musical performance.
all right, we have a good division of opinion here.
that's part of the game of golf?
now, there were two dissenters, one of whom was justice scalia.
there are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman, and there are those who favor state recognition of same-sex marriage.
in the classroom, we have arguments on some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions.
that was easy. ok.
now, there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong, and here it is.
this is not a completely tautological statement; it's a reasonable statement.
fundamental breakthroughs: very hard to predict how long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough.
i have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation.
so in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice, i'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging.
they're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them.
there's a proposal to actually put together an institute.
the standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade.
well let it suffice to say that we felt a bit overwhelmed with testosterone.
so we like to see profits, plus positive social and environmental benefits, when we invest.
for me it was the start of a long journey, but i decided that day to matter.
you know, we say, half the world is living in cities.
but actually, they're spending most of it in their homes, and home investment is about as local an investment as you can get.
so we have study after study now that's tying where you live to your health, particularly as in america, the biggest health crisis we have is this one that's stemming from environmental-induced inactivity.
because if your city is designed around cars, it's really good at smashing them into each other.
so i'm not immune to this.
doing so isn't easy, but it can be done, it has been done, and it's being done now in more than a few cities, around the globe and in our country.
if we could understand how that frog is managing the way its tummy works, is there information here that we need to understand or could usefully use to help ourselves?
we now want this ball of cells to start to gastrulate, to turn in so that it will produce the other tissues.
by 10,000 years ago, they had disappeared from new guinea, and unfortunately by 4,000 years ago, somebodies, we don't know who this was, introduced dingoes -- this is a very archaic kind of a dog — into australia.
but then suddenly cloning did happen.
does it have to stay in a laboratory, or could we put it back where it belongs?
if it had not been illegal to keep these thylacines as pets then, would the thylacine be extinct now?
now this is a huge achievement.
i want to leave this up here and come back to it.
africa has been giving the other countries aid.
we thought she was going to die.
and then my sister woke up.
infrastructure everywhere.
but i worry because this money is so important.
so why don't we think of using some of this aid?
but i'm saying it's not either or.
so take away from here is how are you going to put together the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle who are ready -- business people who want to expand and create more jobs.
and i think that's a good question.
and this was done with a colleague of mine, alan braun, at the nih.
and then we looked at the brain activity.
it's kind of fun actually.
mos def:... brown skin i be, standing five-ten i be rockin 'it when i be, in your vicinity whole-style synergy, recognize symmetry go and try to injure me, broke' em down chemically ain't the number 10 mc, talk about how been i be styled it like kennedy, late like a 10 to three when i say when i be, girls say bend that key cut cl: and so there's a lot of analogy between what takes place in free-style rap and jazz.
cl: that was recorded in the scanner, by the way.
the laws of nature are written in the language of calculus.
when these neurons interact, the chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse, which can be measured.
so the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite is to start with training a neutral signal.
okay. let's try that.
tan le: a headset that reads your brainwaves
now, the reason we were able to come up with this is two key ideas: one is that this is similar to a cryogenic dewar, something you'd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in.
and bed nets have an effect on the epidemic, but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets.
we also have another hemozoin-oriented therapy for malaria: a way, in acute cases, to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system.
we also try to study our foe.
they're sick, and so they're less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes.
and pablos, if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit we can see them flying around.
that's a lot.
this bench, although it was uncomfortable for my mom -- she didn't like sitting on it, so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale -- reusing, a job that was pretty good.
it serves 220 people a day.
but this is an electrical restaurant.
so basically, the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what i was doing anyway.
and i hope you all take part.
they're not even enjoying the show.
i think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day.
this is the wave, going from left to right. you can see this one.
so, they have to survive all the dangers of the beach, and one of the big dangers is the sea. this is the sea.
we're here today to announce the first synthetic cell, a cell made by starting with the digital code in the computer, building the chromosome from four bottles of chemicals, assembling that chromosome in yeast, transplanting it into a recipient bacterial cell and transforming that cell into a new bacterial species.
there were several steps to this. there were two sides: we had to solve the chemistry for making large dna molecules, and we had to solve the biological side of how, if we had this new chemical entity, how would we boot it up, activate it in a recipient cell.
that little issue took the team two years to solve.
so the team actually developed a new code within the code within the code.
craig venter: can we explain how significant this is?
the historian thomas carlyle considered muhammad one of the world's greatest heroes, yet even he called the koran "as toilsome reading as i ever undertook, a wearisome, confused jumble."
it wants to be chanted out loud, to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue.
there are no 72 virgins in the koran.
this is the nest of the mature colony, and there's the nest entrance.
there's the nest entrance, there's a pencil for scale.
and in harvester ants, i divide the tasks of the ants i see just outside the nest into these four categories: where an ant is foraging, when it's out along the foraging trail, searching for food or bringing food back.
there are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest.
this is what it looks like about 20 minutes later.
and finally, it looks like each ant is deciding moment to moment whether to be active or not.
i expect to meet another forager every so often.
in fact, if you watch ants at all, you end up trying to help them because they never seem to be doing anything exactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing it.
so at that point, 1912, we selected crude oil over whale oil and some more coal.
so actually most of the 11 we have are tied up in the mid-east.
but the days of cheap oil are over.
how does that translate to barrels of oil equivalent?
what happened?
but no, i'm not. i own stocks.
tbp: i don't like that because it ends up the government is going to run the program.
i don't know what in the hell he's talking about.
i know what you're telling me, and i'm not disagreeing with you.
the internet was also very real. this is a real way for humans to communicate with each other. it's a big deal.
these are both very successful -- a physician in one case, a surgeon in the other.
i'll just play one of these and you'll remember it.
there's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity.
there's asbestos under that handle there.
everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines.
so we really haven't progressed that much since 1908.
she -- but you know, if you really do believe that it's the very, very beginning, if you believe it's the 1908 hurley washing machine, then you're incredibly optimistic. and i do think that that's where we are.
it happened through a principle known as kin selection.
now, there's one other result of this dynamic called reciprocal altruism, which i think is kind of good news, which is that the way that this is played out in the human species, it has given people an intuitive appreciation of the golden rule.
now, there's one piece of good news i have that may save the world. okay.
and you could basically reformulate what i said earlier, about how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed, by just saying, well, compassion most naturally flows along non-zero-sum channels where people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win-win situation with some of their friends or allies.
for example, probably a lot of american christians don't think of themselves as being in a non-zero-sum relationship with muslims halfway around the world, but they really are, because if these muslims become happier and happier with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it, that's good for americans, because there will be fewer terrorists to threaten american security.
you know, they'll resist that comparison and that's natural, that's human.
now, alice had trouble getting funding for her research.
so for 25 years alice stewart had a very big fight on her hands.
and it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds.
so, he didn't really want to say anything.
openness isn't the end.
and so, the question i raised before becomes even more interesting if you thought about the enormity of this in every one of your bodies.
so, in the chicken you get a tumor, in the embryo you don't, you dissociate, you put it in a dish, you get another tumor.
so, you can imagine the amount of skepticism i received -- couldn't get money, couldn't do a whole lot of other things, but i'm so glad it all worked out.
we inject the other ones in the mouse, 100 percent tumors.
look at it. it's constantly doing this.
why is it that nature keeps doing that over and over again?
now my first professional encounter with deception is a little bit later than these guys, a couple thousand years.
these aren't just people being jerks. these are people that are saying, look, i don't want to talk to you now, or i didn't want to talk to you then, but i still care about you.
here's a couple of studies. one of the studies we do are called diary studies, in which we ask people to record all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days, and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place per conversation within a medium, and the finding that we get that surprises people the most is that email is the most honest of those three media.
now, as you see, most of the little dots are below the line.
just because people can't see us doesn't mean we're going to necessarily lie.
but i want everybody to raise their hand at some point.
what does it mean for us in our lives?
man 7: after this bridge, first exit.
my vision when we started google 15 years ago was that eventually you wouldn't have to have a search query at all.
it's not a demo, more of a philosophical argument: why did sergey brin and his team at google want to build an eye-mounted camera / computer, codenamed glass? onstage at ted2013, brin calls for a new way of seeing our relationship with our mobile computers -- not hunched over a screen but meeting the world heads-up.

the media that is good at creating conversations is no good at creating groups.
last may, china in the sichuan province had a terrible earthquake, 7.9 magnitude, massive destruction in a wide area, as the richter scale has it.
people began to figure out, in the sichuan provence, that the reason so many school buildings had collapsed -- because tragically the earthquake happened during a school day -- the reason so many school buildings collapsed is that corrupt officials had taken bribes to allow those building to be built to less than code.

rob then signed off, and that was the last we ever heard of him.

for the last 30 years, political scientists have observed that there is a constant decline in electoral turnout, and the people who are least interested to vote are the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting.
the very idea of political community totally has changed.
this is also partly a result of the internet revolution.
are you not afraid with all these technologies that are going to track down any statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues, are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians to repeat their positions, even the very wrong positions, because consistency is going to be more important than common sense?
seven.
they've got to have a year to commit their crimes, six months to get through the court system, and then they would be compared to a group taken from the police national computer, as similar as possible, and we would get paid providing we achieved a hurdle rate of 10-percent reduction, for every conviction event that didn't happen.

over the last 13 years -- one, three, 13 years -- i've been part of an exceptional team at insightec in israel and partners around the world for taking this idea, this concept, noninvasive surgery, from the research lab to routine clinical use.
basically, it's a force acting on a tissue that it transverses.
this is his handwriting on the morning of the treatment before going into the mr so now i'll take you through [what] a typical procedure like that looks like, [what] noninvasive surgery looks like.
the temperature was raised to 43 degrees c temporarily.
he suffers from no neurodeficit.

all those tumors have heavy bleeding during periods, abdominal pressure, back pain, frequent urination.
her friend says, "buy it already."
what i'm going to argue today is that because there's no copyright protection in the fashion industry, fashion designers have actually been able to elevate utilitarian design, things to cover our naked bodies, into something that we consider art.
we invited tom ford to come -- the conference was called, "ready to share: fashion and the ownership of creativity" -- and we asked him exactly this question.
he came up with this bowden-wedge heel that has to be made out of steel or titanium; if you make it from some sort of cheaper material, it'll actually crack in two.
in japan, for instance, which i think is the third largest market, they have a design law; it protects apparel, but the novelty standard is so high, you have to prove that your garment has never existed before, it's totally unique.
magic tricks, i think they're instructions, sort of like recipes: no copyright protection.
this is a difficult, unstable binary.

i was going to try and do a 20-minute swim, for one kilometer across the north pole.

are we designing for the world that we have?
and we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits: it had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there, nobody was interested in irrigation projects.
so this is what i mean with a failing governance structure, because even the powerful government, which we have in germany, comparatively, was not able to say, "we will not allow our companies to bribe abroad."
and that's why the law has changed.
we also need much more competence of civil society leaders.
how come, then, it's not so expected to be selective when we go to an art gallery?
and i thought, well, what is that relationship?
not the wife, not the kids. okay, the maid can come in and clean. "
i like this version the best, because some of the boys are older and some are younger, and to me, this one, like goldilocks's porridge, is just right.
this painting made me stop in my tracks for three reasons: one is the disconnection between his mouth that's smiling and his eyes that are wistful.

saint obi: i was so fascinated, you know, with those cowboy movies.
action.
filmmakers, friends of mine, they look at nollywood and they say, "wow, they are doing what we really want to do, and make a buck and live with this job."
and i really hope that there will be many, many collaborations, where we teach each other things.

and in order to explain interaction, we need to really bring people in and make them realize how interaction is part of their lives.
right? we had to make decisions.
we're going to stay with them forever.
and in a way, the video games, the fonts and everything else lead us to make people understand a wider meaning for design.
i don't want you to see what i'm doing up here.
and after we failed, i just kept failing.
and i put them together, and you walk between them.
and he didn't buy a sculpture, so i made one.
and so i did a lot of dirty things with chain link, which nobody will forgive me for.
there were plenty of models for that, in rauschenberg and jasper johns, and many artists who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials.
and so stanley did the little dome thing.
but they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me.
he didn't recommend me, by the way.
the health club is fastened to the garage with a c-clamp, for cleveland.
and then up above there's a garden on this side of the living room, and one on the other side.
and this is in anaheim, california, and it's a freeway building.
and these are the kind of study models we did.
i think i'm from mars for them, and they are for me, but somehow we all manage to work together, and i think, productively.
it has a chamber hall.

and more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day.
we have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward.
it's a shocking truth that we only see mirror images of ourselves, and we only see ourselves in freeze-frame photographic images that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live.

this is an image of ann who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed.
so it's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium.
facial surgeon iain hutchison works with people whose faces have been severely disfigured. by pushing to improve surgical techniques, he helps to improve their lives; and by commissioning their portraits, he celebrates their humanity. note: this talk contains images of disfigured and badly injured faces that may be disturbing -- and hutchison provides thoughtful answers as to why a disfigured face can shock us so deeply. squeamish? hide your screen from 12: 10 - 13: 19, but do keep listening. portraits shown in this talk come from mark gilbert.
and the very first thing was about regional food -- trying to eat food from within our region.
that's what i really try and get people to understand.
but oops, maybe they're responsible for what kids eat.
that's what the government says is okay to feed our kids.
they're not going to be smart.
you know, we have to change it.
it's sort of this "duh" thing.
in this country, we're spending 110 billion dollars a year on fast food.
thank you.
they become lovely monsters.
but they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise.
how is that possible? many people just think it isn't possible at all.
he says, "oh, that's not my department, i'm sorry."
that's because the foveal part of your eye, which is the high-resolution part, is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length.
well, remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady?
how many of you see that sort of boundary, with the necker cube floating in front of the circles?
look in the gray areas, and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there -- yeah, it's amazing. there's nothing there. it's no trick.
this one because it's so large and yet it's pretty hard to see.
it exists in basically all of the cities all around the world, which is a little bit surprising when you think about it.
and let's now look at how we can use this insight to combat road congestion.
and personally, i would like to do this every once a year or so, but they won't let me do that.
who changed their opinion, and why?
and the afghan soldier was so surprised to see me that he forgot to stamp my passport.
it's an amazing thing that we're here to talk about the year of patients rising.
yeah, the wavy hair, the blue eyes -- it was really something.
to make a long story short, i said, "so you need me to get back in there?"
i went home, and i know you can't read the details here; that's not important.
there's one in the skull, and then just for good measure, i had these other tumors -- including, by the time my treatment started, one was growing out of my tongue.
this amazing substance -- again i mentioned, where does my body end?
so she painted this medical facts mural with a nutrition label, something like that, in a diagram of him.
but you see, it's still generic.
and he got them chanting by the end of the talk, "raw data now.
this takes energy, producing clean water.

well, it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats from the equation, we're going to have to then use insecticides to remove all those pest insects that feed on our agricultural crops.
also we look at deafness. one in every 1,000 newborn babies are deaf, and when we reach 80, over half of us will also have a hearing problem.
there are 19 species of mammal that live longer than expected, given their body size, than man, and 18 of those are bats.
what can we actually do?
yes, you tear up the "eleventh commandment" -- national sovereignty.
and i've looked globally, i've taken all the countries in the world for the last 40 years, and looked to see what the relationship is.
just to benchmark that threshold, it's about the governance level of portugal in the mid 1980s.
i can't go through all of them, but i'll give you an example.
and so i realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry.
now, this type of surgery is hard, and it starts by putting people to sleep, putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen, blowing them up like a balloon, sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen -- it's dangerous stuff -- and taking instruments and watching it on a tv screen.
it's hard.
at our hospital we see everybody from harvard professors to people who just got here last week.
that's a tall order. we have to work at it.
orient your loop this way.
so i tried bronze casting.
i couldn't build this the way i knew because hand-tied knots weren't going to withstand a hurricane.
so i replaced the metal armature with a soft, fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel.
and to me this was which allows us to contemplate these landscapes, that i thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work.
you can mimic what you can see.
we all know that as we form thoughts, they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains.
now, it's generally understood that questions of morality -- questions of good and evil and right and wrong -- are questions about which science officially has no opinion.
probably not.
and hundreds of thousands of children, incidentally, are subjected to this every year.
the fact that there are many right answers to the question, "what is food?"
now, granted, for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images.
if you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around, in my experience half of them will say ed witten.
we simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life.
and if the results come out that actually they do, are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues?
so this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere.
and they are very happy with that, apparently.
this is not just an exotic, ornamental sweet pepper.
and no, we do not disrupt the balance.
finally, i want to get actually to my vision, or in fact, to my dream.
this is a home-built rocket-propelled car. that's a 1953 henry j -- i'm a bug for authenticity -- in a quiet neighborhood in toledo.
you needed to know that.
it's a fond memory of times past.
except that he's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff -- they all do -- and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist about to shoot rockets at the tour de france -- sign of our times, i guess.
what is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have?
in a way, just like tolstoy's statement about every unhappy marriage being different, every collapsed or endangered society is different -- they all have different details. but nevertheless, there are certain common threads that emerge from these comparisons of past societies that did or did not collapse and threatened societies today. one interesting common thread has to do with, in many cases, the rapidity of collapse after a society reaches its peak. there are many societies that don't wind down gradually, but they build up -- get richer and more powerful -- and then within a short time, within a few decades after their peak, they collapse. for example, the classic lowland maya of the yucatan began to collapse in the early 800s -- literally a few decades after the maya were building their biggest monuments, and maya population was greatest.
what's going to be the outcome today?
in fact, if we count all the individual organisms, we would come at much larger numbers.
and they prepare it in a wonderful way.
it's being produced in large amounts, 150 to 180 metric tons per year in the canary islands in peru, and it's big business.
now to start with, i should say that we are eating way too much meat in the western world.
if you produce insects, you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce.
so people there are eating them, not because they're hungry, but because they think it's a delicacy.
well in the netherlands, we have an innovative minister of agriculture, and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry.
five weeks ago i had total hip replacement surgery.
i wouldn't have my new hip for tedglobal in africa.
so, next thing you know, i had my bright blue volunteer vest, i had my photo id, and i was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss.
and that question is this.
so the north star corresponds to the center of the device.
they are just incredibly expensive.
he would not only know what time it was, he would also know where the sun would rise, and how it would move across the sky.
how cool is that? this is just amazing.
but before that, let's look at pop culture.
so, we decided to synthesize a mechanical mechanism so we could get rid of all the motors, and with a single motor we can coordinate all the motions.
this robot is called climber: cable-suspended limbed intelligent matching behavior robot.
or use an active tension cords to make it move forward and backward. it's called chimera.
it takes really a lot of time and it's expensive to train the operator to operate this complex arm.
and the goal of robocup, the actual goal is, by the year 2050 we want to have full size, autonomous humanoid robots play soccer against the human world cup champions and win.
we also have the world's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind.
so, we gather around, we discuss about problems and social problems and talk about it.
this picture in the back this is 3 a.m. in the morning.
it's the dependence on farm subsidies and under-performing schools and higher poverty rates in rural areas than in urban.
in fact, two years ago, only 27 percent of all the third- through eighth-graders were passing the state standard in both english and math.
there isn't a single licensed architect in the whole county.

desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert, and this happens only when we create too much bare ground.
now, the environments like you see here, dusty environments in africa where i grew up, and i loved wildlife, and so i grew up hating livestock because of the damage they were doing.
you have changed the microclimate.
so let's do that.
okay? watch the marked tree and see the change as we use livestock to mimic nature.
i'm just going to ask you one quick question.
i would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment for darius, and for me to be told that there might be other dariuses who are not getting treatment, that's just viscerally wrong.
(text: such examinations allow us to improve eye-health in many children, and...
this arc of development gives us unprecedented and extremely valuable information about how the scaffolding of vision gets set up.
doctor: what shape do you see here?
i had to have long conversations with my wife.
so we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we'll have more results to report soon.
and i'd never competed on a disabled level, you know -- i'd always competed against other able-bodied athletes.
you know, he's thinking, "what am i getting myself into?"
i went to my coach: "please, don't make me do this."
and i'm sure of it, you know?
and, you know, i'm just thinking, "oh, my god, my whole family got in a van and drove down here from pennsylvania."
no, these are my cosmetic legs, actually, and they're absolutely beautiful.
ss: she can't really stand on these legs. she has to be moving, so...
and, i mean, it's really -- let me take this off so you can see it.
so... moderator: that's it.
i have excel.
those trying to employ them think they don't know enough.
over the years we've put so much in society into being able to process and think logically. it's part of human society.
we've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject that i could ever imagine with computers.
it's a major subject.
she enjoys making what she calls "paper laptops."
and problems in the real world look nutty and horrible like this.
that's what computers allow us to do.
now i'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question that should be asked in exams, but i think it's a very important type that right now just gets completely ignored and is critical for people's real understanding.
stepping onto the sidewalk, i then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me.
and besides, it's not like i was the first person ever to lose their sight.
what struck me also was how much the city was changing around me.
"god bless you."
they want to earn a living.
so, that was hard.
and this was a very long list -- over 700 rules.
you change your behavior, and you change your mind.
and actually, since this is a tech crowd, i talk in the book about how the bible actually reminds me of the wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years.
but i was saying thanks all the time, every day, and i started to change my perspective.
they have a pamphlet that says, "here's what jesus said about homosexuality," and you open it up, and there's nothing in it.
but my argument is, "what's wrong with cafeterias?"
so memory capacity and disk capacity have been multiplied by something between 10,000 and a million.
has to come back out, whatever you put in.
are you going to get sued by the zoning commission? and so forth.
and then if it's time for analysis, we can pull back a little bit and ask for a different distribution.
the author of this new pointing device is sitting over there, so i can pull this from there to there.
and he wasn't talking about whether the novel costs 24.95 [dollars], or whether you have to spring 70 million bucks to buy the stolen vermeer; he was talking about the circumstances of its creation and of its existence.
well that's cool.
that's all it is, but that's all that's needed because what it does is it takes the tacit information available to the whole population -- everybody knows where the violence is, but no one person knows what everyone knows -- and it takes that tacit information and it aggregates it, and it maps it and it makes it public.
