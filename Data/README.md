The different data preprocessing techniques include: 

* blanks.sh     - all supplementary data is blank (" ")
* duplicate.sh  - all supplementary data is just a copy of the input
* encipher -  supplementary input is encoded using a ROT-k cipher (same as origianl paper)
* random - each character in supplementary input is replaced with a randomly chosen character
* reverse - each word in the supplementary input is the input reversed ( "the dog" &rarr; "eht god")
